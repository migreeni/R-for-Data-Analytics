This  Reveals the diversity crisis in children's and young adult media as not only a lack of representation, but a lack of imaginationStories provide portals into other worlds, both real and imagined. The promise of escape draws people from all backgrounds to speculative fiction, but when people of color seek passageways into the fantastic, the doors are often barred. This problem lies not only with children¡¯s publishing, but also with the television and film executives tasked with adapting these stories into a visual world. When characters of color do appear, they are often marginalized or subjected to violence, reinforcing for audiences that not all lives matter. The Dark Fantastic is an engaging and provocative exploration of race in popular youth and young adult speculative fiction. Grounded in her experiences as YA novelist, fanfiction writer, and scholar of education, Thomas considers four black girl protagonists from some of the most popular stories of the early 21st century: Bonnie Bennett from the CW¡¯s The Vampire Diaries, Rue from Suzanne Collins¡¯s The Hunger Games, Gwen from the BBC¡¯s Merlin, and Angelina Johnson from J.K. Rowling¡¯s Harry Potter. Analyzing their narratives and audience reactions to them reveals how these characters mirror the violence against black and brown people in our own world. In response, Thomas uncovers and builds upon a tradition of fantasy and radical imagination in Black feminism and Afrofuturism to reveal new possibilities. Through fanfiction and other modes of counter-storytelling, young people of color have reinvisioned fantastic worlds that reflect their own experiences, their own lives.

Rowling's first novel - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - no series of children's books has been more incredibly popular or widely influential. How do we explain the enormous appeal of these stories to children? Should parents welcome this new interest in reading among their kids or worry, along with the critics, that the books  Since the 1997 release of J. K. Rowling's first novel - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - no series of children's books has been more incredibly popular or widely influential. How do we explain the enormous appeal of these stories to children? Should parents welcome this new interest in reading among their kids or worry, along with the critics, that the books encourage either moral complacency or a perverse interest in witchcraft and the occult?In this original interpretation of the Harry Potter sensation, Edmund M. Kern argues that the attraction of these stories to children comes not only from the fantastical elements embedded in the plots, but also from their underlying moral messages. Children genuinely desire to follow Harry, as he confronts a host of challenges in an uncertain world, because of his desire to do the right thing. Harry's coherent yet flexible approach to dealing with evil reflects an updated form of Stoicism, says Kern. He argues that Rowling's great accomplishment in these books is to have combined imaginative fun and moral seriousness.Kern's comprehensive evaluation of the Harry Potter stories in terms of ethical questions reveals the importance of uncertainty and ambiguity in Rowling's imaginative world and highlights her call to meet them with typically Stoic virtues: constancy, endurance, perseverance, self-discipline, reason, solidarity, empathy, and sacrifice. Children comprehend that growing up entails some perplexity and pain, that they cannot entirely avoid problems, and that they can remain constant in circumstances beyond their control. In essence, Harry shows them how to work through their problems, rather than seek ways around them. Despite the fantastical settings and events of Harry's adventures, children are quick to realize that they are just a weird reflection of the confusing and disturbing circumstances found in the real world.Kern also shows adults how much they can gain by discussing with children the moral conundrums faced by Harry and other characters. The author outlines the central morals of each book, explains the Stoic principles found in the stories, considers the common critiques of the books, discusses Rowling's skillful blend of history, legend, and myth, and provides important questions for guiding children through Harry's adventures.This fresh, instructive, and upbeat guide to Harry Potter will give parents many useful and educational suggestions for discussing the moral implications of this continuously popular series of books with their children.

Rowling achieved astounding commercial success with her series of novels about Harry Potter, the boy-wizard who finds out about his magical powers on the morning of his eleventh birthday. The books' incredible popularity, and the subsequent likelihood that they are among this generation's most formative narratives, call for critical exploration and study to interpret the works' inherent tropes and themes. The essays in this collection assume that Rowling's works should not be relegated to the categories of pulp fiction or children's trends, which would deny their certain influence on the intellectual, emotional, and psychosocial development of today's children. The variety of contributions allows for a range of approaches and interpretive methods in exploring the novels, and reveals the deeper meanings and attitudes towards justice, education, race, foreign cultures, socioeconomic class, and gender.Following an introductory discussion of the Harry Potter phenomenon are essays considering the psychological and social-developmental experiences of children as mirrored in Rowling's novels. Next, the works' literary and historical contexts are examined, including the European fairy tale tradition, the British abolitionist movement, and the public-school story genre. A third section focuses on the social values underlying the Potter series and on issues such as morality, the rule of law, and constructions of bravery.  ...more"

Chapters: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Source: Wikipedia. Free updates online. Not illustrated. Excerpt: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series written by J. K. Rowling and featuring Harry Potter, a young wizard. It describes how Harry discovers he is a wizard, makes close friends, and a few enemies at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and with the help of his friends thwarts an attempted comeback by the evil wizard Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents and tried to kill Harry when he was one year old. The book was published on 30 June 1997 by Bloomsbury in London, and in the United States under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by Scholastic Corporation in 1998. It won most of the UK book awards that were judged by children, and other awards in the USA. The book reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999, and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into several other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name. Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters looked rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, of Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and of the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.

The astonishing conclusion of this investigation is that Ms. Rowling, demonized by some Christian critics because of the magical setting of her books, is ironically writing the most charming and challenging Christian fiction for children since Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. The Hidden Key demonstrates that all the Potter books teach Christian doctrines- sometimes with subtlety, often baldly- in their plot, imagery and character development. Lambasted by critics who have not read her books closely or are unfamiliar with traditional Christian literature, Ms. Rowling's genius has been overlooked despite her books' success. A lover and teacher of the Great Books- including the great books he reads his seven children- Mr. Granger applies his knowledge of classical philosophy and Christian traditions to reveal the secret message that explains the magic power of Harry Potter.Find out these secrets inside:What is the hidden key to Harry Potter?Is Harry's magic dangerous- or quite the opposite?What is the evidence that Rowling is a Christian novelist?Is the author an ""Inkling""? How have we been so bamboozled?Who is the real-world model for Gilderoy Lockhart?Who is Harry, really? Why does Lord Voldemort want him dead?Will Wormtail kill Voldemort as Wormtongue killed Saruman? What may happen in the upcoming Potter books?How does it all end?- an  unauthorized  prediction.  ...more"

However, many don¡¯t notice how the other characters suffer through the same struggle at every stage of life <U+2013> one Dumbledore and Neville Longbottom pass but Draco Malfoy and Voldemort do not. Exploding into the Wizarding World in 2016, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child offered an unusual double hero¡¯s journey for Albus Severus and Scorpius and a twisted antiheroine¡¯s journey for Delphi. This book demystifies all these, unveiling the nostalgic symbolism behind the play¡¯s auguries, baby blankets, and time-turners. 2016 also introduced Ilvermorney, the American Hogwarts, and its valiant, loving founder Isolt Sayre. Uncovering her folklore and symbolism reveals a secret war between the Celtic old world and the bold pioneer spirit of the new. Meanwhile, Rowling¡¯s original characters overturn Greek, Roman, Norse, and Celtic myths, even as Harry unites King Arthur¡¯s hallows and claims the sword as destined king. Revisioning folklore from England to Africa is one of Rowling¡¯s talents, especially in Beedle the Bard. Rowling also nods to history, from Voldemort¡¯s World War II childhood and Nazi prejudice to the dazzling glitter of the 1920s, setting for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. For serious fans, an entire world of mythology waits below the surface of the ever-expanding Potterverse.  ...more"

Now read on <U+2013> everyone else does...Harry Potter is English, a home-counties suburban child. An orphan, oppressed and abused by the adults around him, he retreats into a fantasy world where his problems are more elemental; everyday rituals, magic spells and supercharged broomsticks with only the occasional homicidal wizard to worry about. Ironically, as Andrew<U+00A0> Blake makes clear, J. K. Rowling rescues her character through the reinvention of that apex of class privilege, the English public school, a literary conceit that problematises Harry Potter¡¯s status as a role model and raises important social questions about the state of education in Tony Blair¡¯s Britain.Andrew Blake¡¯s examination of the Harry Potter phenomenon also raises serious questions about the condition of the publishing industry, the state of bookselling and filmmaking, and the ways in which the Potter consumer campaign has changed our ideas about literature and reading.

Some argue that the capacity to understand narrative is innate to our species; others claim that while that might be so, the invention of writing then re-wired our brains. In  Narrative informs everything we think, do, plan, remember, and imagine. We tell stories and we listen to stories, gauging their well-formedness within a couple of years of learning to walk and talk. Some argue that the capacity to understand narrative is innate to our species; others claim that while that might be so, the invention of writing then re-wired our brains. In The Secret Life of Stories, Michael Berube tells a dramatically different tale, in a compelling account of how an understanding of intellectual disability can transform our understanding of narrative. Instead of focusing on characters with disabilities, he shows how ideas about intellectual disability inform an astonishingly wide array of narrative strategies, providing a new and startling way of thinking through questions of time, self-reflexivity, and motive in the experience of reading. Interweaving his own stories with readings of such texts as Faulkner s The Sound and the Fury, Haddon s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Kingston s The Woman Warrior, and Philip K. Dick s Martian Time-Slip, Berube puts his theory into practice, stretching the purview of the study of literatureand the role of disability studies within it. Armed only with the tools of close reading, Berube demonstrates the immensely generative possibilities in the ways disability is deployed within fiction, finding in them powerful meditations on what it means to be a social being, a sentient creature with an awareness of mortality and causality and sentience itself. Persuasive and witty, Michael Berube engages Harry Potter fans and scholars of literature alike. For all readers, The Secret Life of Stories will fundamentally change the way we think about the way we read. ""  ...more"

You dont need me to tell you that Jesus Christ and Harry are two of the most famous celebrities in the world, whose stories have been translated into dozens of languages and found international support in diverse cultures. What you may not be aware of, however, is the mysterious, complicated and intriguing relationship between them. For  LET¡¯S SKIP THE INTRODUCTIONS. You don¡¯t need me to tell you that Jesus Christ and Harry are two of the most famous celebrities in the world, whose stories have been translated into dozens of languages and found international support in diverse cultures. What you may not be aware of, however, is the mysterious, complicated and intriguing relationship between them. For example, did you know that the topics ¡°I read Harry Potter and Jesus still loves me,¡± ¡°Even Jesus reads Harry Potter¡± and ¡°Harry Potter will return sooner than Jesus¡± each have their own Facebook group, or that Wikipedia has a page dedicated to ¡°Religious debates over the Harry Potter Series¡±? Much more remarkable than their respective popularity is the significant tension <U+2013> and unexpected affinity <U+2013> between them... At first glance it may seem that J.K. Rowling¡¯s boy wizard and the crucified Jesus prophet who became the Christian savior have absolutely nothing to do with each other <U+2013> and yet the unease and sometimes outright animosity between the followers of these two figures suggests otherwise. Harry has been banned, burned, and abused by religious fundamentalists for over a decade. At the release of Rowling¡¯s final book, however, many readers were surprised to discover parallels between Jesus and Harry that, in such apparently diverse world-views, had no right to be there. As a result, recent years have witnessed a revolution in Christian responses to Harry, with many groups, writers and religious leaders praising Rowling¡¯s young sorcerer as ultimately Christian and a clear metaphor for Jesus Christ. And yet the most spine-tingling question has so far been ignored: Why do these similarities exist at all? Although it is easy to accept that Rowling crafted the literary character of Harry Potter after the figure of Jesus, shouldn¡¯t it pique our interest that Jesus <U+2013> a monumental figure in modern world religion generally believed to have been historical <U+2013> has so much in common with the obviously fictional fantasy world and character of Harry Potter?The main distinction, it will be argued, is that Jesus Christ is real: Jesus has traditionally been viewed as a historical figure, while Harry is instantly recognized as fiction. But does this distinction apply to the many seemingly mythical elements in the gospels? Can Jesus¡¯ miracles be separated from Harry¡¯s magic tricks because they really happened <U+2013> or will we allow that certain features of the gospels were exaggerated or intended to be literary. And if so, where do we stop? What protects Jesus from the claim that he is, like Harry, a fictional character?This is the starting point of Jesus Potter Harry Christ; an innovative treatise into religious history, comparative mythology, astrological symbolism and contemporary culture. From ancient mystery religions to modern fairy tales, from fictional Hogwarts to the ruins of Jerusalem, Derek Murphy, PhD in Comparative Literature at one of the world's top universities, narrows in on one crucial question: How do we separate the obviously mythical literature of Jesus Christ from the historical man himself?PRAISE FOR JESUS POTTER HARRY CHRIST:""My initial response to reading the title was that this was a joke of some sort. But I encourage anyone interested in the gospels and Jesus as literature to read the content below and see that it does seek to be a serious contribution to an understanding of the literary and mythical character of Jesus. Neither is this a slur against Christianity. The author rightly explains that the fictional nature of characters does not detract from the positive influence that character can have on those who love them. The author also answers pertinent questions about his rationale for writing such a book, the status, history and grounds of Jesus-mythicism. I particularly like the main idea of this book: Our question then is not whether Jesus Christ existed, but whether the literary character recorded in the New Testament was primarily inspired by a historical figure or previous literary traditions and characters."" Neil Godfrey""Particularly absorbing and highly topical: namely, the idea that nothing substantially separates Jesus of Nazareth from Harry Potter except that most human beings believe in the historical reality of the former. Instead, both figures entertain astonishingly parallel personality traits that derive from universal myths. As part of the continuing debate over the nature of Christ, not only among Christians but between them and today's wave of atheist thinkers, Jesus Potter, Harry Christ is timely. Linking this analysis, moreover, to J. K. Rowling's globally popular character further heightens its relevancy."" Jeff Crouse, Ph.D - Parmenides""This is probably the first time a book encapsulates the works of contemporary mythicists such as G.A. Wells, Timothy Freke, Tom Harpur, Acharya S., Earl Dougherty, and Robert Price. Murphy bares a scalpel intellect in his first scholarly venture, dissecting the figure of Jesus Christ while peeling open the wonderful tales the other rising-dying godmen that once upon a time captivated pagan audiences across western civilization. Murphy never explicitly denies the historicity of Jesus Christ, but indicates that he has been basically swallowed whole by imagination and legendry."" Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio""Absolutely loved it! With so much misinformation being disseminated about Jesus Christ, this book was refreshing. Derek pulls from notable and reliable sources to frame his arguments in a way that is both intriguing and satisfying. His insights into the phenomena that captivate the fans of literary characters like Harry Potter and Jesus Christ are extraordinary. To anyone who enjoys a mystery being unraveled, Harry Potter Jesus Christ is a must read."" Andrea Griffith, The Social I.Q. Lady""I'm impressed. A lot. I figured that ""Jesus Potter, Harry Christ"" would focus on the commonalities between Jesus Christ and Harry Potter, but Murphy's aims are a lot more ambitious. And interesting. In a highly readable yet semi-scholarly style, he sets out to examine the origins and evolution of Christianity, seeking evidence for a historical Jesus who is akin to the mythical figure revered by believers today. While unreal in an objective sense, Murphy demonstrates that the myths told in the New Testament and the Harry Potter series can point to personal truths that offer comfort, solace, and courage to anyone (which, really, is everyone) seeking to live life more fully, happily, and boldly. ""Jesus Potter, Harry Christ"" demolishes part of the foundation of Christianity, Jesus' purported uniqueness and godly heritage, but leaves the most important part: our capacity as humans to become more and better than we are now.""

The collection's three sections address broad issues related to genre, Harry Potter's development as the central heroic character and the question of who qualifies as a hero in the Harry Potter series. Among the topics are Harry Potter as both epic and postmodern hero, the series as a modern-day example of psychomachia, the series' indebtedness to the Gothic tradition, Harry's development in the first six film adaptations, Harry Potter and the idea of the English gentleman, Hermione Granger's explicitly female version of heroism, adult role models in Harry Potter, and the complex depictions of heroism exhibited by the series' minor characters. Together, the essays suggest that the Harry Potter novels rely on established generic, moral and popular codes to develop new and genuine ways of expressing what a globalized world has applauded as ethically exemplary models of heroism based on responsibility, courage, humility and kindness.  ...more"

K. Rowling¡¯s Harry Potter novels have brought joy to children and adults alike. Many conservative Christians in the United States, however, have decried the books as wicked, as preaching witchcraft and the occult, and as glamorizing dishonesty. A minister in New Mexico held a ¡°holy bonfire¡± on the Sunday after Christmas 2001, at which he publicly torched the Potter books, declaring them ¡°an abomination to God and to me.¡±John Killinger, a Congregationalist minister and an academic in the field of contemporary literature, beautifully demolishes the objections of right-wing Christians to this bestselling children¡¯s series. He compellingly argues that, far from corrupting children¡¯s morals, the Potter stories actually influence young readers to follow the teachings of Jesus. He cites passage after passage to illustrate how the world of Harry Potter would be inconceivable apart from the strictures of Judeo-Christian theology and the way human existence should be approached by every follower of Jesus. Additionally, he reflects on the possibility that Harry Potter, like Dostoevsky¡¯s Prince Myshkin and others, is a witting or unwitting Christ figure who actually battles the forces of darkness for the souls of the faithful.All through this extraordinarily well-written, compelling, and very entertaining little book, the author points out that stories like this are worth more than any sermon toward producing people who truly follow the lessons of Jesus.  ...more"

E uscito in lingua originale il 21 luglio 2007, mentre in Italia il 5 gennaio 2008. La Rowling ha dichiarato di aver terminato il libro l'11 gennaio 2007, in un albergo di Edimburgo. Il 28 marzo 2007 sono state rese pubbliche le copertine statunitensi e inglesi del libro (anche nella versione per adulti). Il 16 luglio, pochi giorni prima dell'uscita ufficiale del libro, su internet e comparso un PDF contenente le foto di tutte le pagine del libro che si sarebbe poi rivelato l'originale, rompendo cosi il rigoroso embargo imposto dalla casa editrice. Si trattava della versione statunitense, in cui si potevano leggere tutte le 759 pagine del libro. Il PDF ha cominciato a circolare su canali peer-to-peer. Il giorno prima dell'uscita del libro la Scholastic, la casa editrice che stampa la serie negli Stati Uniti, ha definito tale versione ""convincente,"" ma non aveva rilasciato commenti definitivi sull'autenticita del libro. In seguito la stessa autrice, tramite il suo avvocato, aveva ammesso che delle versioni ""plausibili"" del libro erano cominciate a circolare, ma aveva invitato i lettori a ignorare tali versioni e chiesto a coloro che le avevano lette di non rivelare ad altri elementi del libro. La Scholastic ha quindi affermato che una piccolissima parte delle copie pronte per la distribuzione erano s...  ...more"

Excerpt: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series written by J. K. Rowling and featuring Harry Potter, a young wizard. It describes how Harry discovers he is a wizard, makes close friends and a few enemies at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and with the help of his friends thwarts an attempted comeback by the evil wizard Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents when Harry was one year old. The book was published on 30 June 1997 by Bloomsbury in London, while in 1998 Scholastic Corporation published an edition for the United States market under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The novel won most of the UK book awards that were judged by children, and other awards in the USA. The book reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999, and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into several other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name. Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters looked rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, of Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, ...  ...more"

Forbidden Fruit is fundamentally an apologia for the freedom to read. Author Pearce  From the New Testament to The Diary of Anne Frank to current objections to the Harry Potter series<U+2013>dubbed the most frequently challenged books of the 21st century by the American Library Association<U+2013>the tradition of banning, censoring, and challenging books has been remarkably enduring. Forbidden Fruit is fundamentally an apologia for the freedom to read. Author Pearce Carefoote¡¯s principal interest is not so much in the morality of censorship as in its ultimate futility. In a world where freedom of speech, ideas, and religion clash with various forms of fundamentalism, where, post<U+2014>9/11, democratic societies debate the limits to freedom of speech, Forbidden Fruit calls on all of us to examine the long history of censoring ideas and reminds us that the impetus to ban books is still very much alive. Many of the works discussed in the book are very familiar and most readers will be surprised to see the writing that has been and continues to be challenged in Western society. While most citizens of a democracy say that they oppose literary censorship and support the freedom of expression, Carefoote provokes us to face some of the thorny questions of modern censorship: Where do we stand when the nation¡¯s largest bookseller decides not to carry Hitler¡¯s Mein Kampf? How do we respond when a high school teacher has been disciplined for assigning The Merchant of Venice in a public school? Or when the only bookstore in a small town decides not to carry The Satanic Verses for fear of reprisals? Or when certain magazines and novels, fall into that grey area between literature and pornography. Ironically, it is the Internet, as Carefoote points out, that may finally force governments, schools, and families to talk about what is appropriate for reading and viewing and what is not<U+2013>and, more importantly, why.  ...more"

Abanes begins with an in-depth look at folklore, myths, legends, and fairy tales, and their connection to fantasy. Part one also discusses issues involving child development, the affects of literature on children, and how those affects can ultimately change the course of society. Additionally, Abanes examines pop culture, the media, mass marketing, and the commercialization of children¡¯s literature by corporations interested primarily in making money. This volume then looks at the life of fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien, the popularity of his fantasy works, their content, and what separates them from other fantasy volumes such as Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling and the children¡¯s horror books by R.L. Stine. A particularly interesting survey of Tolkien¡¯s The Lord of the Rings includes a thorough analysis of its storyline, characters, and morality. These are compared side-by-side with Harry Potter. Finally, Abanes gives an overview of our culture¡¯s growing obsession with the occult, paganism, and witchcraft. Why is it happening? When did it begin? How is it influencing today¡¯s youth? All of these questions are answered through a concise, easy-to-understand writing style. Especially fascinating are the numerous sources of documentations that shows children are indeed being drawn to the occult via Harry Potter.

Gadget, videogiochi, perfino un intero parco a tema sono stati dedicati alle vicende del maghetto inglese dalla cicatrice a forma di saetta. Niente di strano, apparentemente. In fondo, rifugiarsi nella fiction sembra quasi la ricetta dei nostri tempi, e tanto meglio se, come nel caso dei romanzi della Rowling, anche la coscienza riceve il suo contentino. Ma allora, si tratta solo di un fortunato mix in cui la seduzione dell'evasione funziona al tempo stesso come anestetico morale? Di una sorta di esperimento onirico guidato in cui la colpa del divertissement viene lavata dalla partecipazione emotiva? Evidentemente no. Al di sotto del meccanismo socio-psicologico che ha sicuramente presieduto al boom mediatico pulsa il cuore di una verita autenticamente umana, del tutto slegata dal momento fittizio della narrazione e dalle infinite possibilita che esso sembra offrire. Una verita che dorme sotto le ceneri dei duelli magici per esplodere lucente nella catastrofe finale... Memento mori. L'intera vicenda e infatti una lunga meditazione sulla morte. Di volta in volta presentata come scandalo e ignominia, o come una vecchia amica con cui rapportarsi da pari a pari, la Morte e la vera co-protagonista di tutta la saga.  ...more"

One day just before his eleventh birthday, an owl tries to deliver a mysterious letter the first of a sequence of events that end in Harry meeting a giant man named Hagrid. Hagrid explains Harry's history to him: When he was a baby, the Dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, attacked and killed his parents in an attempt to kill Harry; but the only mark on Harry was a mysterious lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Now he has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the headmaster is the great wizard Albus Dumbledore. Harry visits Diagon Alley to get his school supplies, especially his very own wand. To get to school, he takes the Hogwarts Express from platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station. On the train, he meets two fellow students who will become his closest friends: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

ELEPHANTINELY IMPRESSED...BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS THE BEST HARRY POTTER IN-DEPTH UNCOVER-ALL-THE-SECRETS-THE-AUTHOR-TRIED-TO-HIDE BOOK EVER.""--AMERICAN CHESTERTON SOCIETY, 25 Nov. 2008____ **Book Description**: In summer 2007, the collective tension was palpable. One by one, legions of breathless fans reached the bittersweet end of the Harry Potter series: rewarded for years of patience, yet experiencing odd combinations of relief and grief, satisfaction with ravenous pining, and often wondering, 'Is that really all there is?' --- Well.... That just depends on how you look at it. --- While J.K. Rowling confirmed that her Harry Potter series has concluded, she also expressed her intent that the Harry Potter books not be fully understood at first reading: not at all. Considering Rowling's cleverness, it would be sad - and also wrong - to think that knowing the crescendo of Deathly Hallows' Chapters 32-36 also means we've fully deciphered absolutely everything in the preceding 4000 pages. Far from it! Beyond the humor, adventure, snogging, red herrings, and even the deaths, Rowling's many-layered series still contains veiled intricacies and misunderstood themes eagerly waiting to be savored with fresh insight. Many of Harry's greatest accomplishments and secrets remain virtually unnoticed by vast multitudes of readers... even some of Rowling's brightest fans. Of course, that isn't an insult to the fans, but rather, a compliment to the genius of Harry's author. J.K. Rowling has scattered a myriad of clues that illuminate Harry's secrets and fly in the face of various criticisms, but her growing plethora of hints could take several years of study--- Not to worry. --- A Harry Potter fan herself since 1999, author Nancy Solon Villaluz spent five years doing exactly that. Rather than rushed conjectures and opinions, inside 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' you will feast on the fruit of 5 years of passionate research and accurately honed insights and plunge into a challenging, in-depth analysis of all seven (7) of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, her companion books, and her influences. Dull? Never! Bring your imagination along as the unique narrative of 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' leaves the typical model of dry study and insightfully takes readers on a thought-provoking metaphorical journey of literary exploration. Travel paths, dodge dragons, and have tea in this witty nonfiction commentary as you daringly tackle the deeper mysteries of Hogwarts 'Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus' (Never Tickle a Sleeping Dragon) school motto, examine oodles of compelling evidence, and are guided beyond the warm shallows of J.K. Rowling's world into the hidden depths of Harry's richness. Many will be stunned by the scholarly discoveries within, others might even be offended; but how many suspect the veritable banquet quietly lingering right in Harry's own pages... just waiting for anyone brave enough to approach the Sleeping Dragons' lair. Do you dare come along? --- ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Nancy Solon Villaluz would rather not 'prattle on' about herself; she feels that any Lockhart-ish claims made here would only cause her readers a few headaches -- and perhaps even a bit of nausea. Instead, she prefers to focus on her goal of lavishly informing her readers on the subject of Harry. (A much better goal than crowing about oneself too much; wouldn't you agree?) But please make sure you've got your wits about you when you venture in: 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' will fearlessly take you into Harry Potter's books as you've never been before! **Please note: this book is not authorized by J.K. Rowling, her publishers, or Warner Bros. and is solely for literary analysis, criticism, and commentary.**  ...more"

A lot of Harry Potter memes rely on knowledge that only fans of the books or movies will have, while others are reaction images that convey a feeling or mood that is understandable just by looking at the meme. How Are Harry Potter Memes Used? Harry Potter memes are often used on social media to make inside jokes. When someone uses a meme like this, they know that fellow fans will understand the reference and get the joke. Since the fan base is so large, and the movies in particular occupy a prominent position in popular culture, it's a fairly safe bet that casual fans, and even non-fans, will recognize some Harry Potter memes. Examples of Harry Potter Memes: Example #1 Image: Hagrid on top and Harry Potter on the bottom. Text line one: You're a unit of power, Harry. Text line two: I'm a watt? Meaning: In the movie, Hagrid tells Harry he's a wizard, and Harry replies, ""I'm a what?"" This is a play on words, as watt is a unit of power. Example #2 Image: A snake lifting itself up off the floor and leaning against a door. Text line one: Excuse me, sir. Text line two: Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior Lord Voldemort? Meaning: This meme makes a joke about a snake, which is typically associated with the antagonist Voldemort, proselytizing for him door to door. Example #3: Image: A walled off escalator. Text line one: Escalator Text line two: To Hogwarts Meaning: In the books and movies, children board a train to Hogwarts by walking through a wall at the train station. The joke here is that instead of just a wall, there is an escalator. Here are 1000 of the best Harry Potter memes:   ...more"

The main depiction of a ""spell"" in the Harry Potter books consists of a gesture made with the character's wand, combined with a spoken or mental incantation. In the books and the associated film series, the names of the majority of these spells or the incantations used to effect them are derived from the classical languages, particularly Latin.

Earlier, every spell cast by the principal characters had been accompanied by the appropriate voiced incantation, although advanced adult practitioners of magic had cast nonverbal spells in previous books. Consequently, the incantations used for some spells introduced in Half-Blood Prince and its sequel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows are unavailable.Spells are listed here by their incantations (when known), with their vernacular names in parenthesis.

Rowling's Harry Potter novels are known throughout the world. They are credited with getting children and adults away from other forms of entertainment and back to reading a book for enjoyment. However, what do children and adults learn from reading these novels? This book examined J.K. Rowling's (2003) novel entitled, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Although this novel has not yet been classified as a fairy tale, it does contain fairy tale elements. This work reviewed literature in the field of folklore, fairy tales, and feminism. Foss' (2004) four-step feminist criticism model was employed to analyze gender portrayals in the novel. According to Foss' model, the novel was analyzed for masculine or feminine perspectives of the world, effects on the audience, improvement of women's lives, and impact on rhetorical theory.

The study found women's roles were more realistically portrayed while men's roles were more traditionally portrayed. The novel both affirmed and contradicted gender roles created by society.  ...more"

The movie version of the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, premiered in 2001, in  Transforming Harry: The Adaptation of Harry Potter in the Transmedia Age is an edited volume of eight essays that look at how the cinematic versions of the seven Harry Potter novels represent an unprecedented cultural event in the history of cinematic adaptation. The movie version of the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, premiered in 2001, in between publication of the fourth and fifth books of this global literary phenomenon. As a result, the production and reception of both novel and movie series became intertwined with one another, creating a fanbase who accessed the series first through the books, first through the movies, and in various other combinations. John Alberti and P. Andrew Miller have gathered scholars to explore and examine the cultural, political, aesthetic, and pedagogical dimensions of this pop culture phenomenon and how it has changed the reception of both the films and books.Divided into two sections, the volume addresses both the fidelity of adaptation and the transmedia adaptations that have evolved around the creation of the books and movies. In her essay, Vera Cuntz-Leng draws on feminist film theory to explore the gaze politics and male objectification operating in the Harry Potter movies. Cassandra Bausman contends that screenwriter Steve Klove's revision of the end of the film version of Deathly Hallows, Part II offers a more politically and ethically satisfying conclusion to the Harry Potter saga than the ending of the Rowling novel.

La filosofia di Harry Potter esplora il romanzo-mondo creato dalla Rowling per affrontare, attraverso l¡¯incontro con i suoi personaggi e le loro storie, questioni filosofiche capitali come il coraggio nel suo legame con l¡¯atto etico, l¡¯amore per la giustizia al di la della legge, il potere (magico) di fare cose con le parole, i limiti della ragione occidentale, le minacce della logica del fascismo, l¡¯amore come forma di eterno nel tempo.  ...more"

Wer war die Maulende Myrte? Was ist ein Ghul? Und wie hie©¬en doch gleich die vier Hauser des Internats Hogwart? Wie lauten die Regeln des Quidditch? Auf solche Fragen findet man jetzt Antwort im neuen Lexikon zu Harry Potter, in dem alle wichtigen und weniger wichtigen Details der neuen Kultbucher akribisch und alphabetisch geordnet aufgelistet sind. Zum einen handelt es sich dabei um die Personen, Wesen, Orte, und Begebenheiten der ersten vier Bande. Dabei erfahrt man zwar nichts, was man nicht auch schon nach Lekture der Romane wusste, doch gerade nach einer langeren Lesepause kann eine solche Hilfe den Wiedereinstieg erleichtern. Daruber hinaus bietet das Lexikon aber auch viele Informationen rund um das Phanomen Harry Potter. Man kann hier die Lebensgeschichte von Joanne Rowling nachlesen, etwas uber ihre literarischen Vorbilder oder den Vorwurf des Plagiats erfahren. Ebenso kann man die genauen Auflagenzahlen eines der erfolgreichsten Bucher aller Zeiten nachlesen und mit den Auflagen anderer Bestseller-Autoren vergleichen. Wer einem Harry Potter-Fanclub beitreten will oder etwas uber die geplante Verfilmung wissen will, wird ebenfalls gut bedient. Am interessantesten wird das Lexikon aber, wenn es auf die Wurzeln von Harry Potter in Marchen, Mythen und Aberglaube eingeht. Ob Alraunen oder Einhorner, Magie oder Hexenverfolgung, der Autor prasentiert mit viel Liebe zum Detail Erlauterungen und gibt Orginaltexte wieder.

Wer war die Maulende Myrte? Was ist ein Ghul? Und wie hie©¬en doch gleich die vier Hauser des Internats Hogwart? Wie lauten die Regeln des Quidditch? Auf solche Fragen findet man jetzt Antwort im neuen Lexikon zu Harry Potter, in dem alle wichtigen und weniger wichtigen Details der neuen Kultbucher akribisch und alphabetisch geordnet aufgelistet sind. Zum einen handelt es sich dabei um die Personen, Wesen, Orte, und Begebenheiten der ersten vier Bande. Dabei erfahrt man zwar nichts, was man nicht auch schon nach Lekture der Romane wusste, doch gerade nach einer langeren Lesepause kann eine solche Hilfe den Wiedereinstieg erleichtern. Daruber hinaus bietet das Lexikon aber auch viele Informationen rund um das Phanomen Harry Potter. Man kann hier die Lebensgeschichte von Joanne Rowling nachlesen, etwas uber ihre literarischen Vorbilder oder den Vorwurf des Plagiats erfahren. Ebenso kann man die genauen Auflagenzahlen eines der erfolgreichsten Bucher aller Zeiten nachlesen und mit den Auflagen anderer Bestseller-Autoren vergleichen. Wer einem Harry Potter-Fanclub beitreten will oder etwas uber die geplante Verfilmung wissen will, wird ebenfalls gut bedient. Am interessantesten wird das Lexikon aber, wenn es auf die Wurzeln von Harry Potter in Marchen, Mythen und Aberglaube eingeht. Ob Alraunen oder Einhorner, Magie oder Hexenverfolgung, der Autor prasentiert mit viel Liebe zum Detail Erlauterungen und gibt Orginaltexte wieder. Ein besonderes Schmankerl: Alle Zauberspruche und ihre meist aus dem Lateinischen stammende Herkunft werden aufgefuhrt. Und wer wei©¬ schon, woher die grausamen Dementoren ihren Namen haben?

Wer war die Maulende Myrte? Was ist ein Ghul? Und wie hie©¬en doch gleich die vier Hauser des Internats Hogwart? Wie lauten die Regeln des Quidditch? Auf solche Fragen findet man jetzt Antwort im neuen Lexikon zu Harry Potter, in dem alle wichtigen und weniger wichtigen Details der neuen Kultbucher akribisch und alphabetisch geordnet aufgelistet sind. Zum einen handelt es sich dabei um die Personen, Wesen, Orte, und Begebenheiten der ersten vier Bande. Dabei erfahrt man zwar nichts, was man nicht auch schon nach Lekture der Romane wusste, doch gerade nach einer langeren Lesepause kann eine solche Hilfe den Wiedereinstieg erleichtern. Daruber hinaus bietet das Lexikon aber auch viele Informationen rund um das Phanomen Harry Potter. Man kann hier die Lebensgeschichte von Joanne Rowling nachlesen, etwas uber ihre literarischen Vorbilder oder den Vorwurf des Plagiats erfahren. Ebenso kann man die genauen Auflagenzahlen eines der erfolgreichsten Bucher aller Zeiten nachlesen und mit den Auflagen anderer Bestseller-Autoren vergleichen. Wer einem Harry Potter-Fanclub beitreten will oder etwas uber die geplante Verfilmung wissen will, wird ebenfalls gut bedient. Am interessantesten wird das Lexikon aber, wenn es auf die Wurzeln von Harry Potter in Marchen, Mythen und Aberglaube eingeht. Ob Alraunen oder Einhorner, Magie oder Hexenverfolgung, der Autor prasentiert mit viel Liebe zum Detail Erlauterungen und gibt Orginaltexte wieder. Ein besonderes Schmankerl: Alle Zauberspruche und ihre meist aus dem Lateinischen stammende Herkunft werden aufgefuhrt. Und wer wei©¬ schon, woher die grausamen Dementoren ihren Namen haben? Daruber hinaus geht Schneideweind auf die Starken und Schwachen der deutschen Ubersetzung ein. Zweifellos benotigt niemand dieses Buch, um die leicht eingangigen Jugendbucher zu verstehen.

Rowlings Harry Potter-serie (1997-), Eoin Colfers Artemis Fowl-serie (2001-2012) samt Mats Strandbergs och Sara Bergmark Elfgrens Engelsforstrilogi (2011-2013) - kan fungera som en utgangspunkt for arbetet kring demokrati, manskliga rattigheter och kulturell mangfald i klassrummet.

I detta arbete kan fantasybockernas skildring av de magiska varldarnas maktforhallanden fungera som allegorier over verklighetens motsvarigheter, samtidigt som de skapar en frammandegorande effekt som hjalper lasaren att betrakta maktfragor utifran, med en distanserad blick. Det ar denna rorelse mellan narhet och distans som ger upphov till fantasylitteraturens magiska mojligheter i vardegrundsarbetet.

The shy young woman was too nervous to approach any of her fellow passengers for a piece of paper or pen, so she sat and gazed out the window of the train while she imagined the world she wanted to create. By the time she arrived  ABOUT THE BOOK In 1990, traveling on a train between London and Manchester, a 25-year-old British woman suddenly had an amazing idea for a novel. The shy young woman was too nervous to approach any of her fellow passengers for a piece of paper or pen, so she sat and gazed out the window of the train while she imagined the world she wanted to create. By the time she arrived home, the woman had a clear idea of the characters and story. Although she had never published any novels or even stories, she set about writing down her ideas, slowly forming them into a complete world. Over the course of the next several years, J.K. Rowling would experience massive life changes and many challenges and joys, from the death of her mother to the birth of her daughter. Through it all, the single, working mother kept on writing. She had to write her entire novel by hand and then type it out on a typewriter. When she found an agent to represent her novel, Rowling was hopeful that her hard work would finally pay off. However, publishers barely gave the novel a second look. After a while, it seemed to Rowling that her novel had just been a waste of time and resources, since nobody else could see the same magic in the manuscript that she could see herself. EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK As each of the six subsequent novels came out, they were all showered with a similar array of honors, awards and mentions. The books include Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In addition to her books winning so many prizes, Rowling herself has received many honors for her imaginative and compelling writing. In 1998, Rowling became the Booksellers Association Author of the Year for Chamber of Secrets. The next year, she became the British Book Awards Author of the Year for Prisoner of Azkaban. Also that year, she was listed by People magazine as one of the 24 Most Intriguing People of 1999. In 2000, Rowling was award the great honor of becoming an officer of Order of the British Empire, under the ruling of Queen Elizabeth III. Rowling's alma mater, University of Exeter, awarded her a Doctor of Letter degree for her work on the Harry Potter series. Also in 2000, she was named Booksellers Association Author of the Year for Prisoner of Azkaban, and was later named ""Best Author"" by the British Book Awards...

Rowling Killed Harry Potter is a detailed critique by Timothy A. Wolf of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the last book in Rowling's acclaimed series, and how he believes she disregarded everything she wrote in her previous novels. For Harry Potter fans, Broken Wand is must-have reading! Using the actual texts, the author finds issues with Rowling's continuity. Like the Trace Charm that would have made it impossible for the teenage Voldemort to get away with killing his Muggle relatives. Or the idea of Harry carrying a piece of Voldemort's soul inside him from the start, when the Dark Lord couldn't even touch him for the first four books. Or ""wandlore,"" which has no consistency to it at all. Citing plot elements like: questioning Harry's account of the murder in the previous book, the Ministry taking over Hogwarts, Snape's Pensieve memories, and Dumbledore explaining his mistakes; Broken Wand maintains that Rowling's Deathly Hallows is essentially just a bad copy of the fifth book in the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Wolf also contends that Dumbledore, Snape, Lily Potter, and Voldemort are completely out of character, and Harry merely repeats the same emotional journey he went through before. Plus, there are many questions and plots left unresolved. About the Author: Timothy A. Wolf spent two years researching and writing Broken Wand. As a science fiction reader his entire life and an adult fan of the Harry Potter novels, he wanted to bring the problems he found with the final book to light. He lives in Franklin, Wisconsin.

Readers young and old alike were captivated by this group of inquisitive, spunky and daring youth, and it didnt take long for the powers that be to decide to bring Harry Potter and Hogwarts to the big screen. Legions of fans followed Harry, Ron and Hermione through to the last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and eagerly anticipated the final books launch to the big screen. When Part One of the film came out in November, 2010, the Broadcast Film Critics Association was impressed, giving the film 87 out of a possible 100 points. Part 1 went on to rack up nearly a billion dollars worldwide, becoming the third highest grossing movie of 2010, behind Toy Story 3 and Alice in Wonderland. It seemed an interminable wait for Part 2 to hit theatres, but when it did in July, 2011, the fans were profusely appreciative, coming out in droves to wait in line for ticket pre-sales. In fact, the film broke a pre-sales record; $32 million was grossed in pre-sales alone. As expected, the film was lauded and earned an estimated $1.3 billion in worldwide revenues.

David Heyman returned as producer, as he had done for the other films of the series, and was joined by J.K. Rowling and David Barron. It was Heyman himself who discovered the as-yet unpublished Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone manuscript back in 1997. He admits that the response from the fans was unprecedented for him; in fact, no other film series followed the same characters throughout a linear storyline throughout eight films. The series, in fact, has gone on to become the highest-grossing series of films of all time. Perhaps what has also helped make the series so successful is having the same screenwriter at the helm for six of the seven books. Buy a copy to keep reading!

Her dramatic testimony - offering insights into her creative process and her emotional attachment to the Harry Potter series - is included, both direct and cross-examination.Beyond the star presence of Ms.Rowling, the case is of general interest because it involves an important but little understood aspect of copyright law: the doctrine of fair use. Fair use refers to situations where one is allowed to use material from a copyrighted work without seeking permission from the author, such as a book critic quoting from a novel or a music critic using a short clip of a song.Fair use applies whether you write on paper or online. But the doctrine has taken on added importance in the Internet Age where almost all of us ""publish"" in one form or another, be it through creating websites, writing blogs or uploading content. And as authors or publishers, we often feel the need to quote, closely paraphrase, or otherwise use material others have created. This is where fair use comes in.Harry Potter and the Order of the Court discusses fair use as it relates to the J.K. Rowling case and in terms of the broader application of the doctrine, offering many specific examples as to what likely does, and does not, constitute fair use.  ...more"

Data la ricchezza di questa saga, la risposta e sicuramente affermativa. Molte cose sono state infatti scritte, ma molte restano ancora da scrivere. E se e gia stata esaminata la prospettiva filosofica, scientifica, traduttiva e, ancora, il fenomeno letterario, cinematografico e mediatico, questo saggio affronta i romanzi da una sfaccettatura insolita, quella del materiale soprannaturale utilizzato nella saga, in connessione con le sue matrici storiche, antropologiche, folkloristiche, mitologiche, metafisiche e magiche. Forse molti non sospettano che questi legami esistano o che siano cosi profondi e variegati: ed e per questo che vi invitiamo a scoprirli in questo volume, grazie al quale e possibile rievocare un po' di quelle atmosfere che hanno fatto sognare, per tre lustri, generazioni di lettori distantissime fra loro per eta e cultura, unificandole in un'unica grande Casa, sotto la scintillante egida di Hogwarts.  ...more"

Rowling, trasposto in due pellicole separate.

La pellicola vede Harry Potter abbandonare Hogwarts per cercare e distruggere gli horcrux, oggetti in cui Lord Voldemort ha imprigionato una parte della propria anima. Daniel Radcliffe riprende il ruolo di Harry, affiancato da Emma Watson (Hermione), Rupert Grint (Ron) e Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort). Le riprese del film sono iniziate a febbraio 2009 e in parte si sono svolte in concomitanza con quelle dell'ottavo e ultimo capitolo. Alla regia del film venne confermato David Yates, gia autore dei precedenti episodi L'ordine della fenice (2007) e Il principe mezzosangue (2009), con lo sceneggiatore Steve Kloves, presente in tutti i film tranne L'ordine della fenice, mentre nelle vesti di produttori figurano David Heyman, David Barron e, per la prima volta, J.

Her dramatic testimony - offering insights into her creative process and her emotional attachment to the Harry Potter series - is included, both direct and cross-examination.Beyond the star presence of Ms.Rowling, the case is of general interest because it involves an important but little understood aspect of copyright law: the doctrine of fair use. Fair use refers to situations where one is allowed to use material from a copyrighted work without seeking permission from the author, such as a book critic quoting from a novel or a music critic using a short clip of a song.Fair use applies whether you write on paper or online. But the doctrine has taken on added importance in the Internet Age where almost all of us ""publish"" in one form or another, be it through creating websites, writing blogs or uploading content.

Rowling seeking to prevent the publication of a Harry Potter encyclopedia.Harry Potter and the Order of the Court discusses the court's decision in the case and its broader implications.The case was highlighted by Ms. Rowling taking the witness stand in her first courtroom appearance. Her dramatic testimony - offering insights into her creative process and her emotional attachment to the Harry Potter series - is included, both direct and cross-examination.Beyond the star presence of Ms.Rowling, the case is of general interest because it involves an important but little understood aspect of copyright law: the doctrine of fair use. Fair use refers to situations where one is allowed to use material from a copyrighted work without seeking permission from the author, such as a book critic quoting from a novel or a music critic using a short clip of a song.Fair use applies whether you write on paper or online. But the doctrine has taken on added importance in the Internet Age where almost all of us ""publish"" in one form or another, be it through creating websites, writing blogs or uploading content. And as authors or publishers, we often feel the need to quote, closely paraphrase, or otherwise use material others have created. This is where fair use comes in.Harry Potter and the Order of the Court discusses fair use as it relates to the J.K. Rowling case and in terms of the broader application of the doctrine, offering many specific examples as to what likely does, and does not, constitute fair use.  ...more"

Excerpt: The following are supporting characters in the Harry Potter series written by J. K. Rowling. From left to right: Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, Harry Melling as Dudley, and Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.The Dursley family are Harry Potter's last living relatives. In order to ensure Harry's safety, Albus Dumbledore placed him in the Dursleys' care when he was a baby. The Dursleys live at Number 4, Privet Drive, Little Whinging in Surrey, England. They are all Muggles, and despise all things related to magic--and anything out of the ordinary in general-and the Wizarding World, especially the Potters. The name ""Dursley"" derives from the small town in Gloucestershire, near Rowling's birthplace. Vernon Dursley is Harry's uncle, Petunia's husband (and therefore Lily Potter's brother-in-law), and Dudley's father. Vernon is described as a big, beefy man, with hardly any neck, and a large moustache. He is very much the head of his family, laying down most of the rules for Harry and doing most of the threatening, as well as spoiling Dudley. He is also the director of a drill-making firm, Grunnings, and seems to be quite successful in his career. He regularly reads the Daily Mail. Uncle Vernon and his wife have grudgingly raised Harry from an early age. He and Petunia never informed Harry about the magical world, including how his parents died; they explained it away as a simple car crash. Unlike Petunia, who proves to have a slight feeling of familial loyalty to Harry, Vernon seems to hate his neph...  ...more"

Excerpt: Within the Harry Potter universe of Harry Potter, constructed in the writings of J. K. Rowling, exist fictional locales serving as the settings for the events in her fantasy novels. These locations are listed below categorised as a dwelling, school, shopping district, or government-affiliated locale. The Weasleys' home, known as the Burrow, is located outside the village of Ottery St Catchpole, also near the home of the Lovegoods, the Diggorys and the Fawcetts. The Burrow was used as the Order of the Phoenix's headquarters, due to the compromised fidelius charm placed on 12 Grimmauld Place, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows until it lost its given protection. The Weasley house has seven floors. It is also quite dilapidated, managing to remain standing only by magic. Despite the house's rundown appearance, Harry remarks on his first visit that it was the best house he had ever been in and it becomes his second favourite place in the world (after Hogwarts). The well-hidden orchard nearby doubles as a Quidditch pitch for the Weasley boys and (secretly) Ginny Weasley due to high surrounding trees, preventing any on looking muggles from seeing. Real Quidditch balls cannot be used in case they escape and fly over the Muggle village. A multitude of garden gnomes infests the garden of the Burrow. The Weasleys own an unusual clock, a manifestation of Molly's anxiety about her family's well-being. Instead of telling time, each hand has the name of a Weasley written on...  ...more"

Nello specifico, vengono approfonditi molti degli aspetti che hanno reso la vicenda del giovane mago cosi vivida ed emozionante sullo schermo, come la scenografia del castello di Hogwarts e i suoi continui cambiamenti, i costumi scolastici degli studenti, o la colonna sonora. Ma non solo. L'autrice si e chiesta: quali sono le ragioni delle variazioni nella trama apportate all'interno delle pellicole? Perche piu cineasti (quattro) si sono avvicendati alla regia dei film di Harry Potter? E inoltre: come si puo considerare il fenomeno nel suo insieme?

Harry Potter no longer solely exists in books; he is everywhere dominating our world and our children's worlds, which is why it is important to analyze just what Harry Potter is teaching our children. Although the Harry Potter series has been critiqued and analyzed by journalists and academics alike, there are fascinating gaps in the analyses. Perhaps the most rousing of these gaps is the virtual lack of attention to the ways in which J. K. Rowling has constructed gender, and the agency of the female characters, within the texts. The purpose of this book is to address this rousing gap, by critically deconstructing the representation of women's agency by the female characters in the Harry Potter books 2-6. The study draws on all of the pre-existing theories, frameworks, underpinnings and themes that came out of the analysis that were set forth in the pilot study/first book that critically deconstructed the first Harry Potter book. There are many different books that discuss the Harry Potter phenomenon, but rarely do they analyze the books through a social justice lens, specifically looking at gender.  ...more"

One aspect of this conversation is whether the series contains a feminist message or not. Many of the early critics of the books were unhappy with an alternate world that seemed to be run by and for males. However, although the first four books of the seven book series appear to support a traditional, masculine perspective on power and worth and promote the insignificance of women in stereotypical roles, this book argues that that is not the entire picture. One underlying truth of the HP series is that the power for change comes not through acquiring wealth or advancing one's career, but through people and practices that are often undervalued or dismissed as unimportant. In the wizarding world of Harry Potter, sociopaths are vanquished and corrupt governments are toppled through behaviors and characteristics more commonly associated with women, particularly mothers.  ...more"

This collection of essays and interviews examines how playful fandom--from fanfiction to Muggle quidditch, cosplay, role-playing games, and even Harry Potter burlesque--not only reimagines the canon but also challenges consumerism, questions notions of identity, and fosters participatory culture. The contributors explore issues applicable to fan studies and performance studies at large, such as the role of performance, the nature of community, and questions of representation and ownership in the digital age. Presented in three parts, the essays discuss discrepancies between sanctioned versions of Harry Potter and fan creations, the reenactment and reinterpretation of the original narrative in fan performance, and collaborative and participatory performances that break down the boundaries between actors and audiences.  ...more"

In the Potterverse, you¡¯ll find: * Real-life places mentioned within J.K. Rowling¡¯s Harry Potter novels. * Real-life locations where Harry Potter movie filming took place. * Real-life sites that significantly influenced Harry Potter movie studio set design. Only 50 miles northwest of the UK¡¯s capital, Oxford is the most convenient outside-London location to visit via public transportation from London. Four iconic Harry Potter Places are found in Oxford¡¯s City Centre, with a fifth Potter Place merely 8 miles northwest of the city. The Bodleian Library contains two film sites: Duke Humfrey¡¯s Library (Hogwarts Library film site) and the Divinity School (Hogwarts¡¯ Infirmary scenes and Goblet of Fire dance lessons). Christ Church College¡¯s Dining Hall was the model used to design the Hogwarts Great Hall set seen in all eight Harry Potter movies. Actual location filming for Sorcerer¡¯s Stone and Chamber of Secrets took place on the grand staircase leading up to the Dining Hall. New College was a film site for some Goblet of Fire courtyard scenes, including the incident when Mad-Eye Moody turned Draco Malfoy into a white ferret. Blenheim Palace, northwest of Oxford, is home to a readily recognizable tree where Order of the Phoenix flash-back scenes of young Severus Snape being bullied by James Potter and his entourage (Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew) were shot. Although near to London, the factors involved in planning an Oxford Wizarding Locations trip are far more complex than those required by any other Potter Place<U+2014>especially if you want to visit Duke Humfrey¡¯s Library. We explain the Duke Humfrey¡¯s Library access dilemma, and provide in-depth directions for determining the best manner and date for your OWLs visit. Our itineraries identify the best order for visiting the OWLs on specific days, whether you arrive in Oxford via train, bus, or rental car. We also provide a fantabulous Oxford Wizarding Locations Map and directions for walking between Oxford arrival points and the central-city OWLs.

En tiu verko kaj por la unua fojo, Balzac provis reuzi personojn jam aperintajn en siaj anta aj verkoj, kaj tiel inventis la teknikon, kiu poste famigis kaj diferencigis La Homan Komedion kompare kun aliaj verkaroj.

In questi mondi narrativi, facciamo esperienza di una realto simulata e proviamo emozioni reali in risposta alle vicende dei personaggi della storia. Le storie sembrano dunque offrirci una simulazione profondamente sentita dell'esperienza sociale. Alcuni psicologi nordamericani hanno compiuto ricerche molto interessanti sul rapporto tra l'esposizione alla finzione narrativa e la capacita di sentire per estensione le emozioni di un'altra persona. In particolare, la simulazione dell'esperienza offerta dalle narrazioni letterarie ci allenerebbe a estendere la nostra comprensione delle altre persone, a incarnare e a capire le loro convinzioni e le loro emozioni, e infine a capire noi stessi"".  ...more"

In order to make that time crunch, filmmakers often have to combine or eliminate secondary characters, consolidate plot lines and sometimes change whole storylines. Inevitably, certain changes will not fit well with some fans, even while they are praised by others. Harry Potter certainly did not escape its share of outrage when book fans saw what had been done to their beloved world, and as the franchise is still hugely popular, debates still rage about what changes were good, bad or just plain bewildering.

The contributions in this volume provide a range of inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to various dimensions of this multifacetted universe. The introductory article focuses on different forms of world building in the novels, the translations, the film series and the fandom. Part I examines various potential sources for Rowling's series in folklore, the Arthurian legend and Gothic literature. Further articles focus on parallels between the ""Harry Potter"" series and Celtic Druidism, the impact Victorian notions of gender roles have had on the representation of the Gaunt family, the reception of (medieval and Early Modern) history in the series and the influence of Christian concepts on the world view expressed in the novels. Part II focuses on a range of prominent political and social themes in the series, including conspiracy, persecution and terror, racism as well as the role of economic, social and cultural capital. Other articles explore the concept of a Magical Criminal Law and its consequences as well as the significance of secrets and forbidden places. The articles in Part III go beyond the novels by taking the stage play ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"", the movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", Pottermore and fan fiction into account. Main topics in this part include trauma theory/PTSD, queerbaiting, a 'post'-colonial analysis of the representation of Native Americans in Rowling's ""History of Magic in North America"" and the depiction of violence, incest and rape in fan fictions.

K Rowling hat zweifellos die Lesegewohnheiten der Jugendlichen rund um die Welt beeinflusst. Buchl den haben bei Erscheinen  Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2010 im Fachbereich Anglistik - Kultur und Landeskunde, einseitig bedruckt, Note: 2,3, Ruhr-Universit t Bochum (Englisches Seminar), Veranstaltung: Performing Myth, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Die Harry Potter Reihe von J. K Rowling hat zweifellos die Lesegewohnheiten der Jugendlichen rund um die Welt beeinflusst. Buchl den haben bei Erscheinen der neuen B nde sogar Sonder ffnungszeiten eingerichtet um dem Andrang Herr zu werden, Postboten haben am Auslieferungstag des neuen Bandes Sonderschichten eingelegt. Aber worauf beruht dieser weltweite Erfolg? Die Antwort ist nicht ganz einfach und beruht meiner Meinung nach auf mehreren Faktoren. Der Hauptfaktor ist, wie ich meine, vor allem die Kombination aus der realen Welt der Leserschaft mit einer fantastischen, unbekannten Welt voller Zauberkraft, Symbolen und Mythen aber auch bermenschlichen F higkeiten. Kinder rund um die Welt wachsen mit M rchen, sowohl in schriftlich fixierter Form als auch durch rein orale Weitergabe, auf; auch hier kommen Symbole und mythische Wesen h ufig vor. Unter diesem Aspekt k nnte man behaupten, dass durch die Harry Potter Reihe das kindliche Erleben wieder ins Ged chtnis gerufen wird, denn die Jugendlichen sind erneut mit bekannten Symbolen und Mythen konfrontiert, so zum Beispiel Geister, Drachen, Geheimg nge oder der Kampf zwischen Gut und B se. In den B nden von J.K. Rowling kommen jedoch weitere Aspekte der mythischen Welt hinzu: die Bedeutung des Einhorns, Wunsch und Verlangen, der Wunsch nach ewigem Leben um nur einige Beispiele zu nennen. Es ist eben dieses Netz aus Symbolen und Mythen, die die Harry Potter B cher auch f r Erwachsene so interessant machen. Bereits David Colbert hat in der Einleitung zu seinem Buch The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter geschrieben, dass one of the pleasures of reading J.K. Rowling is discovering the playful references to history, legend and literature that she hides in her books (Colbert 15). Colbert geht mit meiner Ansic  ...more"

Excerpt: Naruto, romanized as NARUTO) is an ongoing Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. The plot tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, an adolescent ninja who constantly searches for recognition and aspires to become a Hokage, the ninja in his village who is acknowledged as the leader and the strongest of all. The series is based on a one-shot comic by Kishimoto that was published in the August 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump. The manga was first published by Shueisha in 1999 in the 43rd issue of Japan's Weekly Sh nen Jump magazine. Currently, the manga is still being serialized; fifty-one tank bon volumes have been released so far. The manga was later adapted into an anime, which was produced by Studio Pierrot and Aniplex. It premiered across Japan on the terrestrial TV Tokyo network and the anime satellite television network Animax on October 3, 2002. The first series lasted 220 episodes, while Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, has been airing since February 15, 2007.

Extracto: Harry Potter y el prisionero de Azkaban es la tercera pelicula de la serie Harry Potter y fue dirigida por el realizador mexicano Alfonso Cuaron. La pelicula se baso en novela homonima de la escritora J. K. Rowling y se estreno el 4 de junio de 2004, un ano y medio despues de haberse estrenado la pelicula anterior, Harry Potter y la camara secreta. El guion -a cargo de Steve Kloves- presenta una adaptacion de la novela que se tomo mas libertades que en el caso de las dos primeras peliculas de la serie. Este hecho provoco reacciones muy diversas entre los aficionados mas partidarios de una adaptacion fiel del texto literario. El largometraje presta una mayor atencion a la maduracion psicologica y sexual del trio protagonista y, segun la critica, presenta un tono mas oscuro y acorde con la historia del fugitivo Sirius Black, supuesto ferviente servidor del hombre que dejo sin familia a Harry Potter. A pesar de los cambios de tono, continuidad y elenco, El prisionero de Azkaban es, hasta el momento, una de las peliculas de la serie que mas criticas positivas ha conseguido. Ademas, la propia novelista declaro en su momento que El prisionero de Azkaban era su adaptacion favorita hasta la fecha. La duracion de la cinta -141 minutos- la convirtio en su momento en la mas breve de la serie, aun cuando la novela en que se basaba tenia una extension mayor a la de sus predecesoras.

It shows how the law evolved from a means of ensuring order and limiting feuds to become a  Throughout English history the rule of law and the preservation of liberty have been inseparable, and both are intrinsic to England's constitution. This accessible and entertaining history traces thegrowth of the law from its beginnings in Anglo-Saxon times to the present day. It shows how the law evolved from a means of ensuring order and limiting feuds to become a supremely sophisticated dispenser of justice and the primary guardian of civil liberties. This development owed much to the English kings and their judiciary, who, in the twelfth century, forged a unified system of law - predatingthat of any other European country - from almost wholly Anglo-Saxon elements. Yet by the seventeenth century this royal offspring - Oedipus Lex it could be called - was capable of regicide. Since then the law has had a somewhat fractious relationship with that institution upon which the regal mantle of supreme power descended, Parliament. This book tells the story of the common law not merely by describing major developments but by concentrating on prominent personalities and decisive cases relating to the constitution, criminal jurisprudence, and civil liberties. It investigates the great constitutional conflicts, the rise of advocacy, and curious and important cases relating to slavery, insanity, obscenity, cannibalism, the death penalty, and miscarriages of justice. The book concludes by examining the extension of the law into the prosecution of war criminals and protection of universal human rights and the threats posed by over-reaction to national emergencies and terrorism.Devoid of jargon and replete with good stories, Law, Liberty and the Constitution represents a new approach to the telling of legal history and will be of interest to anyone wishing to know more about the common law - the spinal cord of the English body politic. Harry Potter is a former fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge and a practising barrister specialising in criminal defence. He has authored books on the death penalty and Scottish history and wrote and presented an award-winning series on the history of the common law for the BBC.  ...more"

It looks at such areas as literary quality, character analysis and plot analysis, while showing that the novel is contextualised within the British culture which informs it. There¡¯s plenty for Harry Potter fans in its attention to detail and examination of theories, plot holes and more. J K Rowling¡¯s excellence as a writer is explored alongside her occasional shortcomings. Structured in a fun and lighthearted manner, the book gives each chapter a start rating, and assessment includes a look at the heroes and villains in each. Yet it is also a step towards serious literary criticism of the novel, based on the view that the Harry Potter stories should be treated as quality literature. This book is presented to those re-reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows as a prompt for serious consideration of the novel as a work of literature. Inevitably you will agree with much and disagree with much that is written here <U+2013> that is the nature of literary criticism <U+2013> but the process of agreeing and disagreeing develops a more considered critical response. Certainly literary criticism is needed. For a book which has received the massive sales of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (15,000,000 copies in the first twenty-four hours alone) there has so far been amazingly little proper criticism published. This book may be regarded as an early contribution to the literary criticism of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.Demonstrating that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a polished work by a highly skilled writer, this book suggests that it can stand alongside established works of literature. It offers to adult readers as much as it does to the young adults and children that were its first audience, and as such it has the potential to become a true literary classic. The novel¡¯s position in global culture is set out and the moral values of the novel are explored, including Harry¡¯s role as a Christian hero.

E' quindi utile interrogarsi sul ruolo pedagogico che le opere di fantasy rivestono nella crescita dei ragazzi; in primo luogo si puo affermare che le favole assolvono una funzione di insegnamento morale ed etico e lo fanno senza mai essere esplicite, ma alludendo e divertendo. Dietro le avventure mirabolanti dei vari personaggi si intravede una visione antropologica dell'autrice, che descrive il contesto del mondo attuale portando il lettore da una visione di uomo individualista verso una visione di uomo guidato da valori morali, quali la scelta del bene, il dono, il sacrificio, l'amicizia, l'amore. Questo breve saggio visita i territori della fantasia di Hogwarts con il cuore e con la mente, facendone gustare al lettore timori e perplessita e aiutandoci a comprenderla interamente.  ...more"

Utdrag: En dodseter er en tilhenger av Fyrst Voldemort i Harry Potter-serien skrevet av J.K. Rowling. Dodseterne var opprinnelig kjent som Ridderne av Walpurgis, men tok sitt andre navn da Voldemort kastet av seg sin fasade av anstendighet under sitt forste forsok pa a ta over Magidepartementet, det radende organ i Storbritannias magikerverden, og ta makten. Dodseterne tjente som Voldemorts tropper i den forste krigen, og var hans mest tiltrodde og lojale folgesvenner. Oppgavene til dodseterne omfatter a kjempe i slag mot Magidepartementet og Foniksordenen, samt psykologisk krigforing mot de som star opp mot fyrsten deres ved a angripe familiene deres, gjerne med dodelig utfall. En som slutter seg til dodseterne ma forbli lojal overfor Voldemort til sin dod. Voldemort holder streng kontroll med dem og straffer dem hardt for feil; desertering blir straffet med doden. Alle dodsetere er merket med Morkets Merke pa sin venstre arm, der du til vanlig kan se blodarene dine tydelig. Morkets merke, Voldemorts tegn (en hodeskalle med en slange ti tunger) blir brukt til kalle pa dodseterne.

Harry Potter und seine Zauberwelt - zuerst im Buch, dann auf der Leinwand. Das habe ich mir anders vorgestellt! Eine solche Auerung findet sich oft als Reaktion auf einen gerade gesehenen Film, der auf einem bekannten Buch beruht. Die Verfilmung entspricht meist nicht der wahrend des Lesens gesponnenen Vorstellung. Naturlich gibt es auch den entgegengesetzten Fall. Wahrend Romane sich der symbolischen Kraft von Sprache anvertrauen, sind die filmischen Stilmittel von vornherein komplexer, multimedialer. Wie adaptiert man literarische Stoffe fur das Medium Film angemessen? Was macht eine gute Verfilmung aus? Sollte sie sich so nah wie moglich an die Romanhandlung anlehnen oder eigenen asthetischen Regeln genugen? Gerade die phantastische Kinder- und Jugendliteratur stellt den Filmemacher diesbezuglich vor eine Reihe von schwierigen Aufgaben. Eine besondere Herausforderung ist es, zugleich eine kindgerechte Prasentation des Stoffes zu gewahrleisten und das asthetische Potential eben dieses Stoffes in Bild und Ton angemessen umzusetzen. Am Beispiel der Filmadaptionen von Harry Potter, Peter Pan und Die Unendliche Geschichte werden diese Fragen filmanalytisch untersucht.  ...more"

Utdrag: En dodseter er en tilhenger av Fyrst Voldemort i Harry Potter-serien skrevet av J.K. Rowling. Dodseterne var opprinnelig kjent som Ridderne av Walpurgis, men tok sitt andre navn da Voldemort kastet av seg sin fasade av anstendighet under sitt forste forsok pa a ta over Magidepartementet, det radende organ i Storbritannias magikerverden, og ta makten. Dodseterne tjente som Voldemorts tropper i den forste krigen, og var hans mest tiltrodde og lojale folgesvenner. Oppgavene til dodseterne omfatter a kjempe i slag mot Magidepartementet og Foniksordenen, samt psykologisk krigforing mot de som star opp mot fyrsten deres ved a angripe familiene deres, gjerne med dodelig utfall. En som slutter seg til dodseterne ma forbli lojal overfor Voldemort til sin dod. Voldemort holder streng kontroll med dem og straffer dem hardt for feil; desertering blir straffet med doden. Alle dodsetere er merket med Morkets Merke pa sin venstre arm, der du til vanlig kan se blodarene dine tydelig. Morkets merke, Voldemorts tegn (en hodeskalle med en slange ti tunger) blir brukt til kalle pa dodseterne. Nar Voldemort berorer et av merkene, blir de andre sorte, og dodseterne skal da straks immivere til hans side. Standarddrakten til dodseterne er en sort kappe med en hvit hodeskallemaske. Etter Voldemorts plutselige forsvinning etter a ha angrepet Harry Potter som liten, mistet dodseterne sin evne til a fungere effektivt. Magidepartementet pagrep dem og fengslet d...  ...more"

Eine solche Auerung findet sich oft als Reaktion auf einen gerade gesehenen Film, der auf einem bekannten Buch beruht. Die Verfilmung entspricht meist nicht der wahrend des Lesens gesponnenen Vorstellung. Naturlich gibt es auch den entgegengesetzten Fall.

Sollte sie sich so nah wie moglich an die Romanhandlung anlehnen oder eigenen asthetischen Regeln genugen? Gerade die phantastische Kinder- und Jugendliteratur stellt den Filmemacher diesbezuglich vor eine Reihe von schwierigen Aufgaben.
