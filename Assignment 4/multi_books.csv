When the unfolding story of a boy wizard changed the way books are read for all time.  And a webmistress of the Leaky Cauldron, one of the most popular Harry Potter sites on the Internet, Melissa Anelli had a front row seat to it all.

This  Reveals the diversity crisis in children's and young adult media as not only a lack of representation, but a lack of imaginationStories provide portals into other worlds, both real and imagined. The promise of escape draws people from all backgrounds to speculative fiction, but when people of color seek passageways into the fantastic, the doors are often barred. This problem lies not only with children¡¯s publishing, but also with the television and film executives tasked with adapting these stories into a visual world. When characters of color do appear, they are often marginalized or subjected to violence, reinforcing for audiences that not all lives matter. The Dark Fantastic is an engaging and provocative exploration of race in popular youth and young adult speculative fiction. Grounded in her experiences as YA novelist, fanfiction writer, and scholar of education, Thomas considers four black girl protagonists from some of the most popular stories of the early 21st century: Bonnie Bennett from the CW¡¯s The Vampire Diaries, Rue from Suzanne Collins¡¯s The Hunger Games, Gwen from the BBC¡¯s Merlin, and Angelina Johnson from J.K. Rowling¡¯s Harry Potter. Analyzing their narratives and audience reactions to them reveals how these characters mirror the violence against black and brown people in our own world. In response, Thomas uncovers and builds upon a tradition of fantasy and radical imagination in Black feminism and Afrofuturism to reveal new possibilities.

Rowling's first novel - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - no series of children's books has been more incredibly popular or widely influential. How do we explain the enormous appeal of these stories to children? Should parents welcome this new interest in reading among their kids or worry, along with the critics, that the books  Since the 1997 release of J. K. Rowling's first novel - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - no series of children's books has been more incredibly popular or widely influential. How do we explain the enormous appeal of these stories to children? Should parents welcome this new interest in reading among their kids or worry, along with the critics, that the books encourage either moral complacency or a perverse interest in witchcraft and the occult?In this original interpretation of the Harry Potter sensation, Edmund M. Kern argues that the attraction of these stories to children comes not only from the fantastical elements embedded in the plots, but also from their underlying moral messages. Children genuinely desire to follow Harry, as he confronts a host of challenges in an uncertain world, because of his desire to do the right thing. Harry's coherent yet flexible approach to dealing with evil reflects an updated form of Stoicism, says Kern. He argues that Rowling's great accomplishment in these books is to have combined imaginative fun and moral seriousness.Kern's comprehensive evaluation of the Harry Potter stories in terms of ethical questions reveals the importance of uncertainty and ambiguity in Rowling's imaginative world and highlights her call to meet them with typically Stoic virtues: constancy, endurance, perseverance, self-discipline, reason, solidarity, empathy, and sacrifice. Children comprehend that growing up entails some perplexity and pain, that they cannot entirely avoid problems, and that they can remain constant in circumstances beyond their control. In essence, Harry shows them how to work through their problems, rather than seek ways around them. Despite the fantastical settings and events of Harry's adventures, children are quick to realize that they are just a weird reflection of the confusing and disturbing circumstances found in the real world.Kern also shows adults how much they can gain by discussing with children the moral conundrums faced by Harry and other characters. The author outlines the central morals of each book, explains the Stoic principles found in the stories, considers the common critiques of the books, discusses Rowling's skillful blend of history, legend, and myth, and provides important questions for guiding children through Harry's adventures.This fresh, instructive, and upbeat guide to Harry Potter will give parents many useful and educational suggestions for discussing the moral implications of this continuously popular series of books with their children.

Rowling achieved astounding commercial success with her series of novels about Harry Potter, the boy-wizard who finds out about his magical powers on the morning of his eleventh birthday. The books' incredible popularity, and the subsequent likelihood that they are among this generation's most formative narratives, call for critical exploration and study to interpret the works' inherent tropes and themes. The essays in this collection assume that Rowling's works should not be relegated to the categories of pulp fiction or children's trends, which would deny their certain influence on the intellectual, emotional, and psychosocial development of today's children. The variety of contributions allows for a range of approaches and interpretive methods in exploring the novels, and reveals the deeper meanings and attitudes towards justice, education, race, foreign cultures, socioeconomic class, and gender.Following an introductory discussion of the Harry Potter phenomenon are essays considering the psychological and social-developmental experiences of children as mirrored in Rowling's novels. Next, the works' literary and historical contexts are examined, including the European fairy tale tradition, the British abolitionist movement, and the public-school story genre. A third section focuses on the social values underlying the Potter series and on issues such as morality, the rule of law, and constructions of bravery.  ...more"

Chapters: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Source: Wikipedia. Free updates online. Not illustrated. Excerpt: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series written by J. K. Rowling and featuring Harry Potter, a young wizard. It describes how Harry discovers he is a wizard, makes close friends, and a few enemies at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and with the help of his friends thwarts an attempted comeback by the evil wizard Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents and tried to kill Harry when he was one year old. The book was published on 30 June 1997 by Bloomsbury in London, and in the United States under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by Scholastic Corporation in 1998. It won most of the UK book awards that were judged by children, and other awards in the USA. The book reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999, and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into several other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name. Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters looked rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, of Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and of the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.

Low road critics have pawned the bestselling novels as ""the literary equivalent of fast food"" and as a gateway to the occult. But no one has explained the worldwide popularity of Ms. Rowling's fiction or read it as one would read Tolkien, Hemingway, or Shakespeare. The Hidden Key  The Hidden Key to Harry Potter is the first book to take Harry Potter seriously as literature. Low road critics have pawned the bestselling novels as ""the literary equivalent of fast food"" and as a gateway to the occult. But no one has explained the worldwide popularity of Ms. Rowling's fiction or read it as one would read Tolkien, Hemingway, or Shakespeare. The Hidden Key takes the high road to understanding Harry Potter's success, through an exploration of the series' structure, themes, and symbolism. The astonishing conclusion of this investigation is that Ms. Rowling, demonized by some Christian critics because of the magical setting of her books, is ironically writing the most charming and challenging Christian fiction for children since Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. The Hidden Key demonstrates that all the Potter books teach Christian doctrines- sometimes with subtlety, often baldly- in their plot, imagery and character development. Lambasted by critics who have not read her books closely or are unfamiliar with traditional Christian literature, Ms. Rowling's genius has been overlooked despite her books' success. A lover and teacher of the Great Books- including the great books he reads his seven children- Mr. Granger applies his knowledge of classical philosophy and Christian traditions to reveal the secret message that explains the magic power of Harry Potter.Find out these secrets inside:What is the hidden key to Harry Potter?Is Harry's magic dangerous- or quite the opposite?What is the evidence that Rowling is a Christian novelist?Is the author an ""Inkling""?

The book responds by cataloguing the various forms of occultism included in the first four books, offering scriptural responses and discussing the psychological and spiritual dangers associated with the Rowling volumes.The latter half of the book includes: -- an overview of good and evil from the Garden of Eden through cultures ancient and modern-- a mini-encyclopedia of various occult practices, with special attention to those glamorized in the Potter books-- an explanation of the difference between the Potter books and those written by C.S. Lewis or Tolkein, for instance.Finally, the book explains why God has forbidden involvement in the occult and takes a hard look at America's present propensities for the dark side -- a fact the interest in and content of the Potter books all too obviously corroborate.  ...more"

Murphy",4.04,85,32,"LETS SKIP THE INTRODUCTIONS. You dont need me to tell you that Jesus Christ and Harry are two of the most famous celebrities in the world, whose stories have been translated into dozens of languages and found international support in diverse cultures. What you may not be aware of, however, is the mysterious, complicated and intriguing relationship between them. For  LET¡¯S SKIP THE INTRODUCTIONS. You don¡¯t need me to tell you that Jesus Christ and Harry are two of the most famous celebrities in the world, whose stories have been translated into dozens of languages and found international support in diverse cultures. What you may not be aware of, however, is the mysterious, complicated and intriguing relationship between them. For example, did you know that the topics ¡°I read Harry Potter and Jesus still loves me,¡± ¡°Even Jesus reads Harry Potter¡± and ¡°Harry Potter will return sooner than Jesus¡± each have their own Facebook group, or that Wikipedia has a page dedicated to ¡°Religious debates over the Harry Potter Series¡±? Much more remarkable than their respective popularity is the significant tension <U+2013> and unexpected affinity <U+2013> between them... At first glance it may seem that J.K. Rowling¡¯s boy wizard and the crucified Jesus prophet who became the Christian savior have absolutely nothing to do with each other <U+2013> and yet the unease and sometimes outright animosity between the followers of these two figures suggests otherwise. Harry has been banned, burned, and abused by religious fundamentalists for over a decade. At the release of Rowling¡¯s final book, however, many readers were surprised to discover parallels between Jesus and Harry that, in such apparently diverse world-views, had no right to be there. As a result, recent years have witnessed a revolution in Christian responses to Harry, with many groups, writers and religious leaders praising Rowling¡¯s young sorcerer as ultimately Christian and a clear metaphor for Jesus Christ. And yet the most spine-tingling question has so far been ignored: Why do these similarities exist at all? Although it is easy to accept that Rowling crafted the literary character of Harry Potter after the figure of Jesus, shouldn¡¯t it pique our interest that Jesus <U+2013> a monumental figure in modern world religion generally believed to have been historical <U+2013> has so much in common with the obviously fictional fantasy world and character of Harry Potter?The main distinction, it will be argued, is that Jesus Christ is real: Jesus has traditionally been viewed as a historical figure, while Harry is instantly recognized as fiction. But does this distinction apply to the many seemingly mythical elements in the gospels? Can Jesus¡¯ miracles be separated from Harry¡¯s magic tricks because they really happened <U+2013> or will we allow that certain features of the gospels were exaggerated or intended to be literary. And if so, where do we stop? What protects Jesus from the claim that he is, like Harry, a fictional character?This is the starting point of Jesus Potter Harry Christ; an innovative treatise into religious history, comparative mythology, astrological symbolism and contemporary culture. From ancient mystery religions to modern fairy tales, from fictional Hogwarts to the ruins of Jerusalem, Derek Murphy, PhD in Comparative Literature at one of the world's top universities, narrows in on one crucial question: How do we separate the obviously mythical literature of Jesus Christ from the historical man himself?PRAISE FOR JESUS POTTER HARRY CHRIST:""My initial response to reading the title was that this was a joke of some sort. But I encourage anyone interested in the gospels and Jesus as literature to read the content below and see that it does seek to be a serious contribution to an understanding of the literary and mythical character of Jesus. Neither is this a slur against Christianity. The author rightly explains that the fictional nature of characters does not detract from the positive influence that character can have on those who love them. The author also answers pertinent questions about his rationale for writing such a book, the status, history and grounds of Jesus-mythicism. I particularly like the main idea of this book: Our question then is not whether Jesus Christ existed, but whether the literary character recorded in the New Testament was primarily inspired by a historical figure or previous literary traditions and characters."" Neil Godfrey""Particularly absorbing and highly topical: namely, the idea that nothing substantially separates Jesus of Nazareth from Harry Potter except that most human beings believe in the historical reality of the former. Instead, both figures entertain astonishingly parallel personality traits that derive from universal myths. As part of the continuing debate over the nature of Christ, not only among Christians but between them and today's wave of atheist thinkers, Jesus Potter, Harry Christ is timely. Linking this analysis, moreover, to J. K. Rowling's globally popular character further heightens its relevancy."" Jeff Crouse, Ph.D - Parmenides""This is probably the first time a book encapsulates the works of contemporary mythicists such as G.A. Wells, Timothy Freke, Tom Harpur, Acharya S., Earl Dougherty, and Robert Price. Murphy bares a scalpel intellect in his first scholarly venture, dissecting the figure of Jesus Christ while peeling open the wonderful tales the other rising-dying godmen that once upon a time captivated pagan audiences across western civilization. Murphy never explicitly denies the historicity of Jesus Christ, but indicates that he has been basically swallowed whole by imagination and legendry."" Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio""Absolutely loved it! With so much misinformation being disseminated about Jesus Christ, this book was refreshing. Derek pulls from notable and reliable sources to frame his arguments in a way that is both intriguing and satisfying. His insights into the phenomena that captivate the fans of literary characters like Harry Potter and Jesus Christ are extraordinary. To anyone who enjoys a mystery being unraveled, Harry Potter Jesus Christ is a must read."" Andrea Griffith, The Social I.Q. Lady""I'm impressed. A lot. I figured that ""Jesus Potter, Harry Christ"" would focus on the commonalities between Jesus Christ and Harry Potter, but Murphy's aims are a lot more ambitious. And interesting. In a highly readable yet semi-scholarly style, he sets out to examine the origins and evolution of Christianity, seeking evidence for a historical Jesus who is akin to the mythical figure revered by believers today. While unreal in an objective sense, Murphy demonstrates that the myths told in the New Testament and the Harry Potter series can point to personal truths that offer comfort, solace, and courage to anyone (which, really, is everyone) seeking to live life more fully, happily, and boldly. ""Jesus Potter, Harry Christ"" demolishes part of the foundation of Christianity, Jesus' purported uniqueness and godly heritage, but leaves the most important part: our capacity as humans to become more and better than we are now.""

It is the complete collection of the four eBooks in the series A Journey Through... and will examine the colourful characters and curious incidents of the real history of magic, and how they relate to the Hogwarts curriculum of the Harry Potter stories.Spells and charms have captured the imagination for hundreds of years. Warding off evil <U+2013> with talismans and magic circles <U+2013> is something that has concerned people throughout history; potions have long been made have been brewed by apothecaries to make medicines, drugs and poisons, including the elusive Philosopher's Stone; and plants have been important components of medicines as much as myth-making and magic <U+2013> from stink lilies to screaming mandrakes. In this way Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Potions and Herbology are all important subjects in the wizarding world.From the use of bones and shells thousands of years ago, to peering into teacups in the parlours of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, for millennia people have strived to see what fate and fortune holds. The study of the night sky has fascinated those trying to read their destinies: from the star atlases of ancient China to the celestial globes of 17th-century Venice. As well as this, famous folkloric creatures <U+2013> giants, dragons and merpeople <U+2013> and lesser-known beings such as Acromantula and Hippogriffs, all play a key role in Harry Potter's journey. As you'll see, Divination and Astronomy, as well as Care of Magical Creatures, are as central to the Harry Potter stories as Harry, Hermione and Ron.The history of magic is as long as time and as wide as the world. In every culture, in every age, in every place and, probably, in every heart, there is magic.  ...more"

However, many don¡¯t notice how the other characters suffer through the same struggle at every stage of life <U+2013> one Dumbledore and Neville Longbottom pass but Draco Malfoy and Voldemort do not. Exploding into the Wizarding World in 2016, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child offered an unusual double hero¡¯s journey for Albus Severus and Scorpius and a twisted antiheroine¡¯s journey for Delphi. This book demystifies all these, unveiling the nostalgic symbolism behind the play¡¯s auguries, baby blankets, and time-turners. 2016 also introduced Ilvermorney, the American Hogwarts, and its valiant, loving founder Isolt Sayre. Uncovering her folklore and symbolism reveals a secret war between the Celtic old world and the bold pioneer spirit of the new. Meanwhile, Rowling¡¯s original characters overturn Greek, Roman, Norse, and Celtic myths, even as Harry unites King Arthur¡¯s hallows and claims the sword as destined king. Revisioning folklore from England to Africa is one of Rowling¡¯s talents, especially in Beedle the Bard. Rowling also nods to history, from Voldemort¡¯s World War II childhood and Nazi prejudice to the dazzling glitter of the 1920s, setting for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. For serious fans, an entire world of mythology waits below the surface of the ever-expanding Potterverse.  ...more"

Now read on <U+2013> everyone else does...Harry Potter is English, a home-counties suburban child. An orphan, oppressed and abused by the adults around him, he retreats into a fantasy world where his problems are more elemental; everyday rituals, magic spells and supercharged broomsticks with only the occasional homicidal wizard to worry about. Ironically, as Andrew<U+00A0> Blake makes clear, J. K. Rowling rescues her character through the reinvention of that apex of class privilege, the English public school, a literary conceit that problematises Harry Potter¡¯s status as a role model and raises important social questions about the state of education in Tony Blair¡¯s Britain.Andrew Blake¡¯s examination of the Harry Potter phenomenon also raises serious questions about the condition of the publishing industry, the state of bookselling and filmmaking, and the ways in which the Potter consumer campaign has changed our ideas about literature and reading. Blake reflects on how these connections, while drawn up in Britain, act as a template for Harry Potter¡¯s international success.  ...more"

Some argue that the capacity to understand narrative is innate to our species; others claim that while that might be so, the invention of writing then re-wired our brains. In  Narrative informs everything we think, do, plan, remember, and imagine. We tell stories and we listen to stories, gauging their well-formedness within a couple of years of learning to walk and talk. Some argue that the capacity to understand narrative is innate to our species; others claim that while that might be so, the invention of writing then re-wired our brains. In The Secret Life of Stories, Michael Berube tells a dramatically different tale, in a compelling account of how an understanding of intellectual disability can transform our understanding of narrative. Instead of focusing on characters with disabilities, he shows how ideas about intellectual disability inform an astonishingly wide array of narrative strategies, providing a new and startling way of thinking through questions of time, self-reflexivity, and motive in the experience of reading. Interweaving his own stories with readings of such texts as Faulkner s The Sound and the Fury, Haddon s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Kingston s The Woman Warrior, and Philip K. Dick s Martian Time-Slip, Berube puts his theory into practice, stretching the purview of the study of literatureand the role of disability studies within it. Armed only with the tools of close reading, Berube demonstrates the immensely generative possibilities in the ways disability is deployed within fiction, finding in them powerful meditations on what it means to be a social being, a sentient creature with an awareness of mortality and causality and sentience itself. Persuasive and witty, Michael Berube engages Harry Potter fans and scholars of literature alike. For all readers, The Secret Life of Stories will fundamentally change the way we think about the way we read. ""  ...more"

The collection's three sections address broad issues related to genre, Harry Potter's development as the central heroic character and the question of who qualifies as a hero in the Harry Potter series. Among the topics are Harry Potter as both epic and postmodern hero, the series as a modern-day example of psychomachia, the series' indebtedness to the Gothic tradition, Harry's development in the first six film adaptations, Harry Potter and the idea of the English gentleman, Hermione Granger's explicitly female version of heroism, adult role models in Harry Potter, and the complex depictions of heroism exhibited by the series' minor characters. Together, the essays suggest that the Harry Potter novels rely on established generic, moral and popular codes to develop new and genuine ways of expressing what a globalized world has applauded as ethically exemplary models of heroism based on responsibility, courage, humility and kindness.  ...more"

Il 28 marzo 2007 sono state rese pubbliche le copertine statunitensi e inglesi del libro (anche nella versione per adulti). Il 16 luglio, pochi giorni prima dell'uscita ufficiale del libro, su internet e comparso un PDF contenente le foto di tutte le pagine del libro che si sarebbe poi rivelato l'originale, rompendo cosi il rigoroso embargo imposto dalla casa editrice. Si trattava della versione statunitense, in cui si potevano leggere tutte le 759 pagine del libro. Il PDF ha cominciato a circolare su canali peer-to-peer. Il giorno prima dell'uscita del libro la Scholastic, la casa editrice che stampa la serie negli Stati Uniti, ha definito tale versione ""convincente,"" ma non aveva rilasciato commenti definitivi sull'autenticita del libro. In seguito la stessa autrice, tramite il suo avvocato, aveva ammesso che delle versioni ""plausibili"" del libro erano cominciate a circolare, ma aveva invitato i lettori a ignorare tali versioni e chiesto a coloro che le avevano lette di non rivelare ad altri elementi del libro.

Excerpt: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series written by J. K. Rowling and featuring Harry Potter, a young wizard. It describes how Harry discovers he is a wizard, makes close friends and a few enemies at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and with the help of his friends thwarts an attempted comeback by the evil wizard Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents when Harry was one year old. The book was published on 30 June 1997 by Bloomsbury in London, while in 1998 Scholastic Corporation published an edition for the United States market under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The novel won most of the UK book awards that were judged by children, and other awards in the USA. The book reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999, and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into several other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name. Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters looked rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, of Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, ...  ...more"

E uscito in lingua originale il 21 luglio 2007, mentre in Italia il 5 gennaio 2008. La Rowling ha dichiarato di aver terminato il libro l'11 gennaio 2007, in un albergo di Edimburgo. Il 28 marzo 2007 sono state rese pubbliche le copertine statunitensi e inglesi del libro (anche nella versione per adulti). Il 16 luglio, pochi giorni prima dell'uscita ufficiale del libro, su internet e comparso un PDF contenente le foto di tutte le pagine del libro che si sarebbe poi rivelato l'originale, rompendo cosi il rigoroso embargo imposto dalla casa editrice. Si trattava della versione statunitense, in cui si potevano leggere tutte le 759 pagine del libro. Il PDF ha cominciato a circolare su canali peer-to-peer. Il giorno prima dell'uscita del libro la Scholastic, la casa editrice che stampa la serie negli Stati Uniti, ha definito tale versione ""convincente,"" ma non aveva rilasciato commenti definitivi sull'autenticita del libro.

Indeed, the escapades of Harry Potter sparked significant conversation between Burkart and her kids.In this helpful, entertaining guide, Burkart shows how Harry Potter fits into the tradition of fairy tale writing and how this type of literature aids in building a moral framework. She highlights specific situations and emotions from Harry's world that children face in their own life, such as fear, anger, bullies, diversity and the choice of good over evil.Instead of magic words or easy answers, Burkart offers solid, practical advice for helping parents and children navigate Harry Potter's world--and our own--together.  ...more"

Forbidden Fruit is fundamentally an apologia for the freedom to read. Author Pearce  From the New Testament to The Diary of Anne Frank to current objections to the Harry Potter series<U+2013>dubbed the most frequently challenged books of the 21st century by the American Library Association<U+2013>the tradition of banning, censoring, and challenging books has been remarkably enduring. Forbidden Fruit is fundamentally an apologia for the freedom to read. Author Pearce Carefoote¡¯s principal interest is not so much in the morality of censorship as in its ultimate futility. In a world where freedom of speech, ideas, and religion clash with various forms of fundamentalism, where, post<U+2014>9/11, democratic societies debate the limits to freedom of speech, Forbidden Fruit calls on all of us to examine the long history of censoring ideas and reminds us that the impetus to ban books is still very much alive. Many of the works discussed in the book are very familiar and most readers will be surprised to see the writing that has been and continues to be challenged in Western society. While most citizens of a democracy say that they oppose literary censorship and support the freedom of expression, Carefoote provokes us to face some of the thorny questions of modern censorship: Where do we stand when the nation¡¯s largest bookseller decides not to carry Hitler¡¯s Mein Kampf? How do we respond when a high school teacher has been disciplined for assigning The Merchant of Venice in a public school? Or when the only bookstore in a small town decides not to carry The Satanic Verses for fear of reprisals? Or when certain magazines and novels, fall into that grey area between literature and pornography. Ironically, it is the Internet, as Carefoote points out, that may finally force governments, schools, and families to talk about what is appropriate for reading and viewing and what is not<U+2013>and, more importantly, why.  ...more"

Gadget, videogiochi, perfino un intero parco a tema sono stati dedicati alle vicende del maghetto inglese dalla cicatrice a forma di saetta. Niente di strano, apparentemente. In fondo, rifugiarsi nella fiction sembra quasi la ricetta dei nostri tempi, e tanto meglio se, come nel caso dei romanzi della Rowling, anche la coscienza riceve il suo contentino. Ma allora, si tratta solo di un fortunato mix in cui la seduzione dell'evasione funziona al tempo stesso come anestetico morale? Di una sorta di esperimento onirico guidato in cui la colpa del divertissement viene lavata dalla partecipazione emotiva? Evidentemente no. Al di sotto del meccanismo socio-psicologico che ha sicuramente presieduto al boom mediatico pulsa il cuore di una verita autenticamente umana, del tutto slegata dal momento fittizio della narrazione e dalle infinite possibilita che esso sembra offrire. Una verita che dorme sotto le ceneri dei duelli magici per esplodere lucente nella catastrofe finale... Memento mori. L'intera vicenda e infatti una lunga meditazione sulla morte.

One by one, legions of breathless fans reached the bittersweet end of the Harry Potter series: rewarded for years of patience, yet experiencing odd combinations of relief and grief, satisfaction with ravenous pining, and often wondering, 'Is that really all there is?' --- Well.... That just depends on how you look at it. --- While J.K. Rowling confirmed that her Harry Potter series has concluded, she also expressed her intent that the Harry Potter books not be fully understood at first reading: not at all. Considering Rowling's cleverness, it would be sad - and also wrong - to think that knowing the crescendo of Deathly Hallows' Chapters 32-36 also means we've fully deciphered absolutely everything in the preceding 4000 pages. Far from it! Beyond the humor, adventure, snogging, red herrings, and even the deaths, Rowling's many-layered series still contains veiled intricacies and misunderstood themes eagerly waiting to be savored with fresh insight. Many of Harry's greatest accomplishments and secrets remain virtually unnoticed by vast multitudes of readers... even some of Rowling's brightest fans. Of course, that isn't an insult to the fans, but rather, a compliment to the genius of Harry's author. J.K. Rowling has scattered a myriad of clues that illuminate Harry's secrets and fly in the face of various criticisms, but her growing plethora of hints could take several years of study--- Not to worry. --- A Harry Potter fan herself since 1999, author Nancy Solon Villaluz spent five years doing exactly that. Rather than rushed conjectures and opinions, inside 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' you will feast on the fruit of 5 years of passionate research and accurately honed insights and plunge into a challenging, in-depth analysis of all seven (7) of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, her companion books, and her influences. Dull? Never! Bring your imagination along as the unique narrative of 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' leaves the typical model of dry study and insightfully takes readers on a thought-provoking metaphorical journey of literary exploration. Travel paths, dodge dragons, and have tea in this witty nonfiction commentary as you daringly tackle the deeper mysteries of Hogwarts 'Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus' (Never Tickle a Sleeping Dragon) school motto, examine oodles of compelling evidence, and are guided beyond the warm shallows of J.K. Rowling's world into the hidden depths of Harry's richness. Many will be stunned by the scholarly discoveries within, others might even be offended; but how many suspect the veritable banquet quietly lingering right in Harry's own pages... just waiting for anyone brave enough to approach the Sleeping Dragons' lair. Do you dare come along? --- ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Nancy Solon Villaluz would rather not 'prattle on' about herself; she feels that any Lockhart-ish claims made here would only cause her readers a few headaches -- and perhaps even a bit of nausea. Instead, she prefers to focus on her goal of lavishly informing her readers on the subject of Harry. (A much better goal than crowing about oneself too much; wouldn't you agree?) But please make sure you've got your wits about you when you venture in: 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' will fearlessly take you into Harry Potter's books as you've never been before! **Please note: this book is not authorized by J.K. Rowling, her publishers, or Warner Bros. and is solely for literary analysis, criticism, and commentary.**  ...more"

ELEPHANTINELY IMPRESSED...BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS THE BEST HARRY POTTER IN-DEPTH UNCOVER-ALL-THE-SECRETS-THE-AUTHOR-TRIED-TO-HIDE BOOK EVER.""--AMERICAN CHESTERTON SOCIETY, 25 Nov. 2008____ **Book Description**: In summer 2007, the collective tension was palpable. One by one, legions of breathless fans reached the bittersweet end of the Harry Potter series: rewarded for years of patience, yet experiencing odd combinations of relief and grief, satisfaction with ravenous pining, and often wondering, 'Is that really all there is?' --- Well.... That just depends on how you look at it. --- While J.K. Rowling confirmed that her Harry Potter series has concluded, she also expressed her intent that the Harry Potter books not be fully understood at first reading: not at all. Considering Rowling's cleverness, it would be sad - and also wrong - to think that knowing the crescendo of Deathly Hallows' Chapters 32-36 also means we've fully deciphered absolutely everything in the preceding 4000 pages. Far from it! Beyond the humor, adventure, snogging, red herrings, and even the deaths, Rowling's many-layered series still contains veiled intricacies and misunderstood themes eagerly waiting to be savored with fresh insight. Many of Harry's greatest accomplishments and secrets remain virtually unnoticed by vast multitudes of readers... even some of Rowling's brightest fans. Of course, that isn't an insult to the fans, but rather, a compliment to the genius of Harry's author. J.K. Rowling has scattered a myriad of clues that illuminate Harry's secrets and fly in the face of various criticisms, but her growing plethora of hints could take several years of study--- Not to worry. --- A Harry Potter fan herself since 1999, author Nancy Solon Villaluz spent five years doing exactly that. Rather than rushed conjectures and opinions, inside 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' you will feast on the fruit of 5 years of passionate research and accurately honed insights and plunge into a challenging, in-depth analysis of all seven (7) of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, her companion books, and her influences. Dull? Never! Bring your imagination along as the unique narrative of 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' leaves the typical model of dry study and insightfully takes readers on a thought-provoking metaphorical journey of literary exploration. Travel paths, dodge dragons, and have tea in this witty nonfiction commentary as you daringly tackle the deeper mysteries of Hogwarts 'Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus' (Never Tickle a Sleeping Dragon) school motto, examine oodles of compelling evidence, and are guided beyond the warm shallows of J.K. Rowling's world into the hidden depths of Harry's richness. Many will be stunned by the scholarly discoveries within, others might even be offended; but how many suspect the veritable banquet quietly lingering right in Harry's own pages... just waiting for anyone brave enough to approach the Sleeping Dragons' lair. Do you dare come along? --- ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Nancy Solon Villaluz would rather not 'prattle on' about herself; she feels that any Lockhart-ish claims made here would only cause her readers a few headaches -- and perhaps even a bit of nausea. Instead, she prefers to focus on her goal of lavishly informing her readers on the subject of Harry. (A much better goal than crowing about oneself too much; wouldn't you agree?) But please make sure you've got your wits about you when you venture in: 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' will fearlessly take you into Harry Potter's books as you've never been before! **Please note: this book is not authorized by J.K. Rowling, her publishers, or Warner Bros. and is solely for literary analysis, criticism, and commentary.**  ...more"

Il 28 marzo 2007 sono state rese pubbliche le copertine statunitensi e inglesi del libro (anche nella versione per adulti). Il 16 luglio, pochi giorni prima dell'uscita ufficiale del libro, su internet e comparso un PDF contenente le foto di tutte le pagine del libro che si sarebbe poi rivelato l'originale, rompendo cosi il rigoroso embargo imposto dalla casa editrice. Si trattava della versione statunitense, in cui si potevano leggere tutte le 759 pagine del libro. Il PDF ha cominciato a circolare su canali peer-to-peer. Il giorno prima dell'uscita del libro la Scholastic, la casa editrice che stampa la serie negli Stati Uniti, ha definito tale versione ""convincente,"" ma non aveva rilasciato commenti definitivi sull'autenticita del libro. In seguito la stessa autrice, tramite il suo avvocato, aveva ammesso che delle versioni ""plausibili"" del libro erano cominciate a circolare, ma aveva invitato i lettori a ignorare tali versioni e chiesto a coloro che le avevano lette di non rivelare ad altri elementi del libro.

One by one, legions of breathless fans reached the bittersweet end of the Harry Potter series: rewarded for years of patience, yet experiencing odd combinations of relief and grief, satisfaction with ravenous pining, and often wondering, 'Is that really all there is?' --- Well.... That just depends on how you look at it. --- While J.K. Rowling confirmed that her Harry Potter series has concluded, she also expressed her intent that the Harry Potter books not be fully understood at first reading: not at all. Considering Rowling's cleverness, it would be sad - and also wrong - to think that knowing the crescendo of Deathly Hallows' Chapters 32-36 also means we've fully deciphered absolutely everything in the preceding 4000 pages. Far from it! Beyond the humor, adventure, snogging, red herrings, and even the deaths, Rowling's many-layered series still contains veiled intricacies and misunderstood themes eagerly waiting to be savored with fresh insight. Many of Harry's greatest accomplishments and secrets remain virtually unnoticed by vast multitudes of readers... even some of Rowling's brightest fans. Of course, that isn't an insult to the fans, but rather, a compliment to the genius of Harry's author. J.K. Rowling has scattered a myriad of clues that illuminate Harry's secrets and fly in the face of various criticisms, but her growing plethora of hints could take several years of study--- Not to worry. --- A Harry Potter fan herself since 1999, author Nancy Solon Villaluz spent five years doing exactly that. Rather than rushed conjectures and opinions, inside 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' you will feast on the fruit of 5 years of passionate research and accurately honed insights and plunge into a challenging, in-depth analysis of all seven (7) of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, her companion books, and her influences. Dull? Never! Bring your imagination along as the unique narrative of 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' leaves the typical model of dry study and insightfully takes readers on a thought-provoking metaphorical journey of literary exploration. Travel paths, dodge dragons, and have tea in this witty nonfiction commentary as you daringly tackle the deeper mysteries of Hogwarts 'Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus' (Never Tickle a Sleeping Dragon) school motto, examine oodles of compelling evidence, and are guided beyond the warm shallows of J.K. Rowling's world into the hidden depths of Harry's richness. Many will be stunned by the scholarly discoveries within, others might even be offended; but how many suspect the veritable banquet quietly lingering right in Harry's own pages... just waiting for anyone brave enough to approach the Sleeping Dragons' lair. Do you dare come along? --- ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Nancy Solon Villaluz would rather not 'prattle on' about herself; she feels that any Lockhart-ish claims made here would only cause her readers a few headaches -- and perhaps even a bit of nausea. Instead, she prefers to focus on her goal of lavishly informing her readers on the subject of Harry. (A much better goal than crowing about oneself too much; wouldn't you agree?) But please make sure you've got your wits about you when you venture in: 'Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?' will fearlessly take you into Harry Potter's books as you've never been before! **Please note: this book is not authorized by J.K.

The Harry Potter universe has been ever-expanding since J.K. Rowling¡¯s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer¡¯s Stone was released in 1997, providing 20 years of content to work with. Because there are so many amazing, clever, and dumb Harry Potter memes out there, we thought we¡¯d round up some of the best ones for you. Most of these memes are pretty in-universe, poking fun at some of the characters¡¯ most iconic lines and looks. There are also quite a few crossovers into real life since Harry Potter has become so deeply ingrained in fans¡¯ psyches. Why not ask someone on a first date what their Hogwarts house is? And why not reread the entire Harry Potter series for the 100th time? Nothing¡¯s stopping you. You¡¯ll always love the world Rowling made. The first Harry Potter book was published in 1997, and the final film based on the book series was released in 2011. Both the books and the movies were wildly popular, and Harry Potter memes have been a mainstay on the internet for longer than some of the youngest fans of the series have even been alive. What Do Harry Potter Memes Mean? Harry Potter memes can mean a variety of different things. A lot of Harry Potter memes rely on knowledge that only fans of the books or movies will have, while others are reaction images that convey a feeling or mood that is understandable just by looking at the meme. How Are Harry Potter Memes Used? Harry Potter memes are often used on social media to make inside jokes. When someone uses a meme like this, they know that fellow fans will understand the reference and get the joke. Since the fan base is so large, and the movies in particular occupy a prominent position in popular culture, it's a fairly safe bet that casual fans, and even non-fans, will recognize some Harry Potter memes. Examples of Harry Potter Memes: Example #1 Image: Hagrid on top and Harry Potter on the bottom. Text line one: You're a unit of power, Harry. Text line two: I'm a watt? Meaning: In the movie, Hagrid tells Harry he's a wizard, and Harry replies, ""I'm a what?"" This is a play on words, as watt is a unit of power. Example #2 Image: A snake lifting itself up off the floor and leaning against a door. Text line one: Excuse me, sir. Text line two: Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior Lord Voldemort? Meaning: This meme makes a joke about a snake, which is typically associated with the antagonist Voldemort, proselytizing for him door to door. Example #3: Image: A walled off escalator. Text line one: Escalator Text line two: To Hogwarts Meaning: In the books and movies, children board a train to Hogwarts by walking through a wall at the train station. The joke here is that instead of just a wall, there is an escalator. Here are 1000 of the best Harry Potter memes:   ...more"

Rowling's Harry Potter novels are known throughout the world. They are credited with getting children and adults away from other forms of entertainment and back to reading a book for enjoyment. However, what do children and adults learn from reading these novels? This book examined J.K. Rowling's (2003) novel entitled, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Although this novel has not yet been classified as a fairy tale, it does contain fairy tale elements. This work reviewed literature in the field of folklore, fairy tales, and feminism. Foss' (2004) four-step feminist criticism model was employed to analyze gender portrayals in the novel. According to Foss' model, the novel was analyzed for masculine or feminine perspectives of the world, effects on the audience, improvement of women's lives, and impact on rhetorical theory. Although Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not a feminist tale, it has the potential to affect women and men positively and negatively. The study found women's roles were more realistically portrayed while men's roles were more traditionally portrayed. The novel both affirmed and contradicted gender roles created by society.  ...more"

The movie version of the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, premiered in 2001, in  Transforming Harry: The Adaptation of Harry Potter in the Transmedia Age is an edited volume of eight essays that look at how the cinematic versions of the seven Harry Potter novels represent an unprecedented cultural event in the history of cinematic adaptation. The movie version of the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, premiered in 2001, in between publication of the fourth and fifth books of this global literary phenomenon. As a result, the production and reception of both novel and movie series became intertwined with one another, creating a fanbase who accessed the series first through the books, first through the movies, and in various other combinations. John Alberti and P. Andrew Miller have gathered scholars to explore and examine the cultural, political, aesthetic, and pedagogical dimensions of this pop culture phenomenon and how it has changed the reception of both the films and books.Divided into two sections, the volume addresses both the fidelity of adaptation and the transmedia adaptations that have evolved around the creation of the books and movies. In her essay, Vera Cuntz-Leng draws on feminist film theory to explore the gaze politics and male objectification operating in the Harry Potter movies. Cassandra Bausman contends that screenwriter Steve Klove's revision of the end of the film version of Deathly Hallows, Part II offers a more politically and ethically satisfying conclusion to the Harry Potter saga than the ending of the Rowling novel. Michelle Markey Butler's ""Harry Potter and the Surprising Venue of Literary Critiques"" argues that the fan-generated memes work as a kind of popular literary analysis in three particular areas: the roles of female characters, the comparative analysis of books and films, and the comparative analysis of the Harry Potter series with other works of fantasy.While the primary focus of the collection is an academic audience, it will appeal to a broad range of readers. Within the academic community, Transforming Harry will be of interest to scholars and teachers in a number of disciplines, including film and media studies and English. Beyond the classroom, the Harry Potter series clearly enjoys a large and devoted global fan community, and this collection will be of interest to serious fans.  ...more"

For a society to function orderly  If you love wizards, witches, and Hogwarts, and if you are curious about the law, this book is for you. It explores the intersection of Harry Potter's adventures and the law of our society. It uses the twists and turns in the experiences of our favorite, and some not-so-favorite, characters as case examples to illustrate legal principles. For a society to function orderly and for people to live together without chaos, there must be laws and rules for people to follow. Thus, law is a critical component for any civilized society, including ours and Harry's. Law is what differentiates anarchy from order and civility. Law imposes penalties - such as jail or fines - for illegal acts. Law also provides a mechanism to settle disputes among people and protect our rights as individuals. Curious minds want to know more. This book contains 11 modules, 10 of which cover a major category of law and consist of numerous chapters that have a common theme. Examples of the modules include Criminal Law, Family Law, and School Law. The chapters within a module address a specific area of law such as Identity Theft, Child Neglect, and Bullying. Each chapter includes the following components: a short vignette from the Harry Potter stories, an explanation of the relevant Muggle law, and a explanation of how the law of our world would be applied to the wizarding situation.  ...more"

The Harry Potter series stands as one compelling narrative, rooted in Rowling's Anglican convictions of the communion of saints, the power of sacraments, the redemption of sacrificial love, and the defeat of death in the resurrection through grace.Tricia Lyons identifies, clarifies, and systematizes the Christian themes J.K.

Females and Harry Potter is a deconstruction of the representations of women's agency in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Using critical discourse analysis and focusing on five themes (rule following and breaking, intelligence, validating and enabling, mothering, and resistance), Mayes-Elma explores the construction of traditional gender roles in the book. Additionally, the author locates the foundations of feminist epistemology-binary oppositions, gender boundaries, and woman as 'other'-that is deeply embedded within the book's themes. Traditional gender constructions of both men and women are found throughout the Sorcerer's Stone. Ultimately, the book explores the sexism inherent in the Harry Potter series: a hero and his male friends are the focus and center of activity and the female characters are enablers-at best. Passive and invisible female characters exist only as bodies, 'bound' by traditional gender conventions; they resist evil, but never gender stereotypes. Mayes-Elma concludes with a discussion of the implications for development of school curricula that enable students to critically deconstruct these texts.  ...more"

For a society to function orderly  If you love wizards, witches, and Hogwarts, and if you are curious about the law, this book is for you. It explores the intersection of Harry Potter's adventures and the law of our society. It uses the twists and turns in the experiences of our favorite, and some not-so-favorite, characters as case examples to illustrate legal principles. For a society to function orderly and for people to live together without chaos, there must be laws and rules for people to follow. Thus, law is a critical component for any civilized society, including ours and Harry's. Law is what differentiates anarchy from order and civility. Law imposes penalties - such as jail or fines - for illegal acts. Law also provides a mechanism to settle disputes among people and protect our rights as individuals. Curious minds want to know more. This book contains 11 modules, 10 of which cover a major category of law and consist of numerous chapters that have a common theme. Examples of the modules include Criminal Law, Family Law, and School Law. The chapters within a module address a specific area of law such as Identity Theft, Child Neglect, and Bullying. Each chapter includes the following components: a short vignette from the Harry Potter stories, an explanation of the relevant Muggle law, and a explanation of how the law of our world would be applied to the wizarding situation.  ...more"

Wer war die Maulende Myrte? Was ist ein Ghul? Und wie hie©¬en doch gleich die vier Hauser des Internats Hogwart? Wie lauten die Regeln des Quidditch? Auf solche Fragen findet man jetzt Antwort im neuen Lexikon zu Harry Potter, in dem alle wichtigen und weniger wichtigen Details der neuen Kultbucher akribisch und alphabetisch geordnet aufgelistet sind. Zum einen handelt es sich dabei um die Personen, Wesen, Orte, und Begebenheiten der ersten vier Bande. Dabei erfahrt man zwar nichts, was man nicht auch schon nach Lekture der Romane wusste, doch gerade nach einer langeren Lesepause kann eine solche Hilfe den Wiedereinstieg erleichtern. Daruber hinaus bietet das Lexikon aber auch viele Informationen rund um das Phanomen Harry Potter. Man kann hier die Lebensgeschichte von Joanne Rowling nachlesen, etwas uber ihre literarischen Vorbilder oder den Vorwurf des Plagiats erfahren. Ebenso kann man die genauen Auflagenzahlen eines der erfolgreichsten Bucher aller Zeiten nachlesen und mit den Auflagen anderer Bestseller-Autoren vergleichen. Wer einem Harry Potter-Fanclub beitreten will oder etwas uber die geplante Verfilmung wissen will, wird ebenfalls gut bedient. Am interessantesten wird das Lexikon aber, wenn es auf die Wurzeln von Harry Potter in Marchen, Mythen und Aberglaube eingeht. Ob Alraunen oder Einhorner, Magie oder Hexenverfolgung, der Autor prasentiert mit viel Liebe zum Detail Erlauterungen und gibt Orginaltexte wieder.

Wer war die Maulende Myrte? Was ist ein Ghul? Und wie hie©¬en doch gleich die vier Hauser des Internats Hogwart? Wie lauten die Regeln des Quidditch? Auf solche Fragen findet man jetzt Antwort im neuen Lexikon zu Harry Potter, in dem alle wichtigen und weniger wichtigen Details der neuen Kultbucher akribisch und alphabetisch geordnet aufgelistet sind. Zum einen handelt es sich dabei um die Personen, Wesen, Orte, und Begebenheiten der ersten vier Bande. Dabei erfahrt man zwar nichts, was man nicht auch schon nach Lekture der Romane wusste, doch gerade nach einer langeren Lesepause kann eine solche Hilfe den Wiedereinstieg erleichtern. Daruber hinaus bietet das Lexikon aber auch viele Informationen rund um das Phanomen Harry Potter. Man kann hier die Lebensgeschichte von Joanne Rowling nachlesen, etwas uber ihre literarischen Vorbilder oder den Vorwurf des Plagiats erfahren. Ebenso kann man die genauen Auflagenzahlen eines der erfolgreichsten Bucher aller Zeiten nachlesen und mit den Auflagen anderer Bestseller-Autoren vergleichen. Wer einem Harry Potter-Fanclub beitreten will oder etwas uber die geplante Verfilmung wissen will, wird ebenfalls gut bedient. Am interessantesten wird das Lexikon aber, wenn es auf die Wurzeln von Harry Potter in Marchen, Mythen und Aberglaube eingeht. Ob Alraunen oder Einhorner, Magie oder Hexenverfolgung, der Autor prasentiert mit viel Liebe zum Detail Erlauterungen und gibt Orginaltexte wieder.

Rowling seeking to prevent the publication of a Harry Potter encyclopedia.Harry Potter and the Order of the Court discusses the court's decision in the case and its broader implications.The case was highlighted by Ms. Rowling taking the witness stand in her first courtroom appearance. Her dramatic testimony - offering insights into her creative process and her emotional attachment to the Harry Potter series - is included, both direct and cross-examination.Beyond the star presence of Ms.Rowling, the case is of general interest because it involves an important but little understood aspect of copyright law: the doctrine of fair use. Fair use refers to situations where one is allowed to use material from a copyrighted work without seeking permission from the author, such as a book critic quoting from a novel or a music critic using a short clip of a song.Fair use applies whether you write on paper or online. But the doctrine has taken on added importance in the Internet Age where almost all of us ""publish"" in one form or another, be it through creating websites, writing blogs or uploading content. And as authors or publishers, we often feel the need to quote, closely paraphrase, or otherwise use material others have created. This is where fair use comes in.Harry Potter and the Order of the Court discusses fair use as it relates to the J.K. Rowling case and in terms of the broader application of the doctrine, offering many specific examples as to what likely does, and does not, constitute fair use.  ...more"

For Harry Potter fans, Broken Wand is must-have reading! Using the actual texts, the author finds issues with Rowling's continuity. Like the Trace Charm that would have made it impossible for the teenage Voldemort to get away with killing his Muggle relatives. Or the idea of Harry carrying a piece of Voldemort's soul inside him from the start, when the Dark Lord couldn't even touch him for the first four books. Or ""wandlore,"" which has no consistency to it at all. Citing plot elements like: questioning Harry's account of the murder in the previous book, the Ministry taking over Hogwarts, Snape's Pensieve memories, and Dumbledore explaining his mistakes; Broken Wand maintains that Rowling's Deathly Hallows is essentially just a bad copy of the fifth book in the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Wolf also contends that Dumbledore, Snape, Lily Potter, and Voldemort are completely out of character, and Harry merely repeats the same emotional journey he went through before. Plus, there are many questions and plots left unresolved. About the Author: Timothy A. Wolf spent two years researching and writing Broken Wand.

Readers young and old alike were captivated by this group of inquisitive, spunky and daring youth, and it didnt take long for the powers that be to decide to bring Harry Potter and Hogwarts to the big screen. Legions of fans followed Harry, Ron and Hermione through to the last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and eagerly anticipated the final books launch to the big screen. When Part One of the film came out in November, 2010, the Broadcast Film Critics Association was impressed, giving the film 87 out of a possible 100 points. Part 1 went on to rack up nearly a billion dollars worldwide, becoming the third highest grossing movie of 2010, behind Toy Story 3 and Alice in Wonderland. It seemed an interminable wait for Part 2 to hit theatres, but when it did in July, 2011, the fans were profusely appreciative, coming out in droves to wait in line for ticket pre-sales. In fact, the film broke a pre-sales record; $32 million was grossed in pre-sales alone. As expected, the film was lauded and earned an estimated $1.3 billion in worldwide revenues. MEET THE AUTHOR Chris St-Jean is an Ontario English teacher with a great passion for American literature in particular and the written word in general.

Currently, she is working towards a black belt in karate EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK David Yates, who also directed Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, directed both parts of the series finale. David Heyman returned as producer, as he had done for the other films of the series, and was joined by J.K. Rowling and David Barron. It was Heyman himself who discovered the as-yet unpublished Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone manuscript back in 1997. He admits that the response from the fans was unprecedented for him; in fact, no other film series followed the same characters throughout a linear storyline throughout eight films. The series, in fact, has gone on to become the highest-grossing series of films of all time. Perhaps what has also helped make the series so successful is having the same screenwriter at the helm for six of the seven books. Buy a copy to keep reading!

For example, how does Harry get past the Dementor attack so that he can time travel latter and save himself from the Dementor attack? Isn't that impossible? Richard Jones explains how this might in fact be possible and examines more generally how time travel works in the book, along with its problems. For example, did Harry and Hermione change history? Did Harry and Hermione have free will for what they did or were their actions fixed in advance? If we can time-travel to save Sirius and Buckbeak, why can't we time-travel to save others? What did Professor Dumbledore know and when did he know it? Did Hermione get younger by all her time-traveling during the school year? Jones answers these and many other questions. He also extensively discusses fans' competing theories of how time travel works in the Prisoner of Azakaban. Also included is a brief introduction to the theories of time and time travel in physics and philosophy that are utilized in science fiction and other time travel stories, along with a bibliography of relevant works. Do physicists and philosophers think time is real? Is time-travel possible at all? Can we in fact change the past? After finishing this book, you will have a much greater understanding of both J. K. Rowling's work and a better appreciation of the problems of time and time-travel in general.  ...more"

Rowling seeking to prevent the publication of a Harry Potter encyclopedia.Harry Potter and the Order of the Court discusses the court's decision in the case and its broader implications.The case was highlighted by Ms. Rowling taking the witness stand in her first courtroom appearance. Her dramatic testimony - offering insights into her creative process and her emotional attachment to the Harry Potter series - is included, both direct and cross-examination.Beyond the star presence of Ms.Rowling, the case is of general interest because it involves an important but little understood aspect of copyright law: the doctrine of fair use. Fair use refers to situations where one is allowed to use material from a copyrighted work without seeking permission from the author, such as a book critic quoting from a novel or a music critic using a short clip of a song.Fair use applies whether you write on paper or online. But the doctrine has taken on added importance in the Internet Age where almost all of us ""publish"" in one form or another, be it through creating websites, writing blogs or uploading content. And as authors or publishers, we often feel the need to quote, closely paraphrase, or otherwise use material others have created. This is where fair use comes in.Harry Potter and the Order of the Court discusses fair use as it relates to the J.K. Rowling case and in terms of the broader application of the doctrine, offering many specific examples as to what likely does, and does not, constitute fair use.  ...more"

Estratto: Harry Potter e i Doni della Morte: Parte I (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I) e un film del 2010 diretto da David Yates e basato sulla prima parte dell'omonimo romanzo di J. K. Rowling, trasposto in due pellicole separate. La data di uscita del primo film era stata fissata da Warner Bros per il 19 novembre 2010 in Italia, Stati Uniti d'America e Regno Unito, mentre il secondo, Harry Potter e i Doni della Morte: Parte II, e stato distribuito il 13 luglio 2011. La pellicola vede Harry Potter abbandonare Hogwarts per cercare e distruggere gli horcrux, oggetti in cui Lord Voldemort ha imprigionato una parte della propria anima. Daniel Radcliffe riprende il ruolo di Harry, affiancato da Emma Watson (Hermione), Rupert Grint (Ron) e Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort). Le riprese del film sono iniziate a febbraio 2009 e in parte si sono svolte in concomitanza con quelle dell'ottavo e ultimo capitolo. Alla regia del film venne confermato David Yates, gia autore dei precedenti episodi L'ordine della fenice (2007) e Il principe mezzosangue (2009), con lo sceneggiatore Steve Kloves, presente in tutti i film tranne L'ordine della fenice, mentre nelle vesti di produttori figurano David Heyman, David Barron e, per la prima volta, J. K. Rowling in persona. Harry Potter e ormai il simbolo della speranza del mondo magico di fronte all'avanzata di Voldemort e dei suoi Mangiamorte. I membri dell'Ordine della Fenice organizzano il suo trasporto verso un luogo sicuro, la Tana, ossia la casa della famiglia Weasley, ma il gruppo viene attaccato, con la perdita di Edvige e Malocchio Moody.

The finally chosen scope of this paper refers to my general interest in mythology and legend as well as to Rowling's admiring aptitude to equip her characters from an extraordinary variety of backgrounds. Names are the most obvious means of depicting literary characters and their intended personalities. Yet, considering the multiplicity of those characters in the ever further developed seven novels, further specification appears to be necessary to meet the demands of this paper. Therefore, its focus is limited to character names and in that to several selected characters only, whose names demonstrate mythological background most efficiently. To that effect, I am not exclusively following a selective principle regarding the characters' significance in the books. Surely enough, there are several major characters bearing names grounded on mythology, yet Rowling placed so many according hints and links on minor characters and on figures not even acting in the story(ies) themselves that it would seem a squandering of her labour to concentrate on particular 'significant' characters only. ...]  ...more"

If you haven't heard of me, you probably live in the ¡°Human World¡±. You may be wondering what an Arch-Mage is and what he does, and I don't blame you. For you to know that, you'd have to belong to our world, the ¡°Magick World¡±. You see, every 200 years an Arch-Mage dies, and beneath the Golden Tree of Light, a new one is born from pure energy. Every Arch-Mage lives to be 200, and when the bell strikes midnight on the day of their 200th birthday, they die. But don't let that get you down, 200 years is still A LOT of time. My duty as an Arch-Mage is to live in the ¡°Human World¡±, your world, so I can protect people from magical threats, like dangerous artifacts and creatures who want to do evil. I know it sounds like a lonely job, but don't worry, I have my best friends to help me. When I was born, the Mage Council picked two magical creatures to help me throughout my adventures, something that happens every time one of us is born. I may be the most powerful mage on Earth, but everybody needs help once in a while. My two best friends are Vladimir and Jake. As you may have guessed, Vlad is a vampire, but he's one of the good ones. I've never met anyone as smart as him, or as nerdy. On the other hand we have Jake, a shape shifter, meaning he can transform into anyone or anything he wants. Jake is the athlete in the group, and since we have a genius and an athlete, I guess I¡¯m the lazy one in the gang. All three of us are fourteen and we go to the same middle school, this way we are always together and we can learn how to live a ¡°normal life¡± in your world. Unfortunately, being in middle school is the same for everyone: homework, bullies and mean teachers are everywhere. But I¡¯m not everyone, and if I have to go to school, I¡¯m gonna do it my way!

Excerpt: Within the Harry Potter universe of Harry Potter, constructed in the writings of J. K. Rowling, exist fictional locales serving as the settings for the events in her fantasy novels. These locations are listed below categorised as a dwelling, school, shopping district, or government-affiliated locale. The Weasleys' home, known as the Burrow, is located outside the village of Ottery St Catchpole, also near the home of the Lovegoods, the Diggorys and the Fawcetts. The Burrow was used as the Order of the Phoenix's headquarters, due to the compromised fidelius charm placed on 12 Grimmauld Place, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows until it lost its given protection. The Weasley house has seven floors. It is also quite dilapidated, managing to remain standing only by magic. Despite the house's rundown appearance, Harry remarks on his first visit that it was the best house he had ever been in and it becomes his second favourite place in the world (after Hogwarts).

The Weasleys own an unusual clock, a manifestation of Molly's anxiety about her family's well-being. Instead of telling time, each hand has the name of a Weasley written on...  ...more"

Excerpt: Joanne ""Jo"" Rowling, OBE (born 31 July 1965), better known as J. K. Rowling ( -ling), is a British author best known as the creator of the Harry Potter fantasy series, the idea for which was conceived on a train trip from Manchester to London in 1990. The Potter books have gained worldwide attention, won multiple awards, sold more than 400 million copies and been the basis for a popular series of films, in which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts as well as maintaining creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment. Rowling is perhaps equally famous for her ""rags to riches"" life story, in which she progressed from living on benefits to multi-millionaire status within five years. As of March 2011, when its latest world billionaires list was published, Forbes estimated Rowling's net worth to be US$1 billion. The 2008 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at 560 million ($798 million), ranking her as the twelfth richest woman in the United Kingdom. Forbes ranked Rowling as the forty-eighth most powerful celebrity of 2007, and Time magazine named her as a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fans. In October 2010, J. K. Rowling was named 'Most Influential Woman in Britain' by leading magazine editors. She has become a notable philanthropist, supporting such charities as Comic Relief, One Parent Families, Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain, and Lumos (formerly the Childr...  ...more"

Harry Potter no longer solely exists in books; he is everywhere dominating our world and our children's worlds, which is why it is important to analyze just what Harry Potter is teaching our children. Although the Harry Potter series has been critiqued and analyzed by journalists and academics alike, there are fascinating gaps in the analyses. Perhaps the most rousing of these gaps is the virtual lack of attention to the ways in which J. K. Rowling has constructed gender, and the agency of the female characters, within the texts. The purpose of this book is to address this rousing gap, by critically deconstructing the representation of women's agency by the female characters in the Harry Potter books 2-6. The study draws on all of the pre-existing theories, frameworks, underpinnings and themes that came out of the analysis that were set forth in the pilot study/first book that critically deconstructed the first Harry Potter book. There are many different books that discuss the Harry Potter phenomenon, but rarely do they analyze the books through a social justice lens, specifically looking at gender.  ...more"

In order to make that time crunch, filmmakers often have to combine or eliminate secondary characters, consolidate plot lines and sometimes change whole storylines. Inevitably, certain changes will not fit well with some fans, even while they are praised by others. Harry Potter certainly did not escape its share of outrage when book fans saw what had been done to their beloved world, and as the franchise is still hugely popular, debates still rage about what changes were good, bad or just plain bewildering.

Di solito ci immergiamo nel mondo rappresentato e veniamo trasportati in luoghi nuovi con persone nuove. In questi mondi narrativi, facciamo esperienza di una realto simulata e proviamo emozioni reali in risposta alle vicende dei personaggi della storia. Le storie sembrano dunque offrirci una simulazione profondamente sentita dell'esperienza sociale. Alcuni psicologi nordamericani hanno compiuto ricerche molto interessanti sul rapporto tra l'esposizione alla finzione narrativa e la capacita di sentire per estensione le emozioni di un'altra persona. In particolare, la simulazione dell'esperienza offerta dalle narrazioni letterarie ci allenerebbe a estendere la nostra comprensione delle altre persone, a incarnare e a capire le loro convinzioni e le loro emozioni, e infine a capire noi stessi"".  ...more"

In the Potterverse, you¡¯ll find: * Real-life places mentioned within J.K. Rowling¡¯s Harry Potter novels. * Real-life locations where Harry Potter movie filming took place. * Real-life sites that significantly influenced Harry Potter movie studio set design. Only 50 miles northwest of the UK¡¯s capital, Oxford is the most convenient outside-London location to visit via public transportation from London. Four iconic Harry Potter Places are found in Oxford¡¯s City Centre, with a fifth Potter Place merely 8 miles northwest of the city. The Bodleian Library contains two film sites: Duke Humfrey¡¯s Library (Hogwarts Library film site) and the Divinity School (Hogwarts¡¯ Infirmary scenes and Goblet of Fire dance lessons). Christ Church College¡¯s Dining Hall was the model used to design the Hogwarts Great Hall set seen in all eight Harry Potter movies. Actual location filming for Sorcerer¡¯s Stone and Chamber of Secrets took place on the grand staircase leading up to the Dining Hall. New College was a film site for some Goblet of Fire courtyard scenes, including the incident when Mad-Eye Moody turned Draco Malfoy into a white ferret. Blenheim Palace, northwest of Oxford, is home to a readily recognizable tree where Order of the Phoenix flash-back scenes of young Severus Snape being bullied by James Potter and his entourage (Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew) were shot. Although near to London, the factors involved in planning an Oxford Wizarding Locations trip are far more complex than those required by any other Potter Place<U+2014>especially if you want to visit Duke Humfrey¡¯s Library. We explain the Duke Humfrey¡¯s Library access dilemma, and provide in-depth directions for determining the best manner and date for your OWLs visit. Our itineraries identify the best order for visiting the OWLs on specific days, whether you arrive in Oxford via train, bus, or rental car.

La romano, kies intrigo situas en la Parizo de 1819, temas pri la miksitaj destinoj de tri efpersonoj: la maljuna kaj senila Goriot, la mistera kaj maskita krimulo Vautrin, kaj naiva jurstudento nomita Eugene de Rastignac. Unue eldonita en pluraj epizodoj dum la vintro de 1834-35, Patro Goriot restas rigardata de plejmultaj komentistoj kiel la plej grava romano de Balzac. En tiu verko kaj por la unua fojo, Balzac provis reuzi personojn jam aperintajn en siaj anta aj verkoj, kaj tiel inventis la teknikon, kiu poste famigis kaj diferencigis La Homan Komedion kompare kun aliaj verkaroj.

One aspect of this conversation is whether the series contains a feminist message or not. Many of the early critics of the books were unhappy with an alternate world that seemed to be run by and for males. However, although the first four books of the seven book series appear to support a traditional, masculine perspective on power and worth and promote the insignificance of women in stereotypical roles, this book argues that that is not the entire picture. One underlying truth of the HP series is that the power for change comes not through acquiring wealth or advancing one's career, but through people and practices that are often undervalued or dismissed as unimportant. In the wizarding world of Harry Potter, sociopaths are vanquished and corrupt governments are toppled through behaviors and characteristics more commonly associated with women, particularly mothers.  ...more"

One aspect of this conversation is whether the series contains a feminist message or not. Many of the early critics of the books were unhappy with an alternate world that seemed to be run by and for males. However, although the first four books of the seven book series appear to support a traditional, masculine perspective on power and worth and promote the insignificance of women in stereotypical roles, this book argues that that is not the entire picture. One underlying truth of the HP series is that the power for change comes not through acquiring wealth or advancing one's career, but through people and practices that are often undervalued or dismissed as unimportant. In the wizarding world of Harry Potter, sociopaths are vanquished and corrupt governments are toppled through behaviors and characteristics more commonly associated with women, particularly mothers.  ...more"

This collection of essays and interviews examines how playful fandom--from fanfiction to Muggle quidditch, cosplay, role-playing games, and even Harry Potter burlesque--not only reimagines the canon but also challenges consumerism, questions notions of identity, and fosters participatory culture. The contributors explore issues applicable to fan studies and performance studies at large, such as the role of performance, the nature of community, and questions of representation and ownership in the digital age. Presented in three parts, the essays discuss discrepancies between sanctioned versions of Harry Potter and fan creations, the reenactment and reinterpretation of the original narrative in fan performance, and collaborative and participatory performances that break down the boundaries between actors and audiences.  ...more"

However, unlike prior games like the action-oriented Goblet of Fire, this time the adventure is in the style of a sandbox game.

Excerpt: Connection Timeout The list of Harry Potter cast members is a list of actors who voiced or portrayed characters appearing in the Harry Potter film series based on the book series by J. K. Rowling. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have played Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in all the films. When they were cast only Radcliffe had previously acted in a film. Complementing them on screen are some of the most renowned actors of the United Kingdom and Ireland, including Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, John Hurt, Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, and Julie Walters, among others. Twelve actors have appeared as the same character in all eight films of the franchise. Some well-known British actors who have not appeared in the series, are asked in jest why they have not been cast. In 2007, when Yates was directing the fifth film, Bill Nighy, who had previously collaborated with Yates on three of his television projects, said that he joked with Yates that maybe now he wouldn't be the only actor in England who hadn't been in Harry Potter. ""But nobody called,"" Nighy added. Ironically, in 2009, Nighy was cast as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in Deathly Hallows, which Yates...  ...more"

The introductory article focuses on different forms of world building in the novels, the translations, the film series and the fandom. Part I examines various potential sources for Rowling's series in folklore, the Arthurian legend and Gothic literature. Further articles focus on parallels between the ""Harry Potter"" series and Celtic Druidism, the impact Victorian notions of gender roles have had on the representation of the Gaunt family, the reception of (medieval and Early Modern) history in the series and the influence of Christian concepts on the world view expressed in the novels. Part II focuses on a range of prominent political and social themes in the series, including conspiracy, persecution and terror, racism as well as the role of economic, social and cultural capital. Other articles explore the concept of a Magical Criminal Law and its consequences as well as the significance of secrets and forbidden places. The articles in Part III go beyond the novels by taking the stage play ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"", the movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", Pottermore and fan fiction into account. Main topics in this part include trauma theory/PTSD, queerbaiting, a 'post'-colonial analysis of the representation of Native Americans in Rowling's ""History of Magic in North America"" and the depiction of violence, incest and rape in fan fictions.

Other articles explore the concept of a Magical Criminal Law and its consequences as well as the significance of secrets and forbidden places. The articles in Part III go beyond the novels by taking the stage play ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"", the movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", Pottermore and fan fiction into account. Main topics in this part include trauma theory/PTSD, queerbaiting, a 'post'-colonial analysis of the representation of Native Americans in Rowling's ""History of Magic in North America"" and the depiction of violence, incest and rape in fan fictions. The concluding article highlights the diversification of the Potterverse and analyses strategies informing its ongoing expansion.  ...more"

One aspect of this conversation is whether the series contains a feminist message or not. Many of the early critics of the books were unhappy with an alternate world that seemed to be run by and for males. However, although the first four books of the seven book series appear to support a traditional, masculine perspective on power and worth and promote the insignificance of women in stereotypical roles, this book argues that that is not the entire picture. One underlying truth of the HP series is that the power for change comes not through acquiring wealth or advancing one's career, but through people and practices that are often undervalued or dismissed as unimportant. In the wizarding world of Harry Potter, sociopaths are vanquished and corrupt governments are toppled through behaviors and characteristics more commonly associated with women, particularly mothers.  ...more"

The contributors explore issues applicable to fan studies and performance studies at large, such as the role of performance, the nature of community, and questions of representation and ownership in the digital age. Presented in three parts, the essays discuss discrepancies between sanctioned versions of Harry Potter and fan creations, the reenactment and reinterpretation of the original narrative in fan performance, and collaborative and participatory performances that break down the boundaries between actors and audiences.  ...more"

Rowling's Harry Potter books, Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials and Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins' Left Behind series. The act of creating fantasy counter-worlds naturally involves all three stories in the  Three recent and commercially successful series of novels employ and adapt the resources of popular fantasy fiction to create visions of religious identity: J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials and Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins' Left Behind series. The act of creating fantasy counter-worlds naturally involves all three stories in the creation of what Mike Gray terms ""transfigurations of transcendence"": hopeful albeit paradoxical encodings of the ambiguous, non-observable reality whose primary locus in modern society is the societally extra-systemic human individual. Popular fantasy fiction turns out to involve acts of world-creation that are inherently religious and inherently paradoxical. A substantive examination shows that all three are involved in more or less intentional re-narrations of traditional Christian beliefs and narratives. The atheist His Dark Materials series does not deny but re-imagines the Christian visions of selfhood; the traditionalist Left Behind series does not simply replicate but modifies its own declared values; the apparent secularity of the Harry Potter series is shaped by its creative reception of Christian patterns and narratives. While the stories' visions of selfhood clearly clash, the basic paradoxes involved in their struggle to articulate transcendence expose significant parallels and a productive conversation with the Christian tradition. It is not simply that popular fantasy fiction is theologically relevant - the Christian Heilsgeschichte, too, proves to be highly relevant in popular culture. However, while far from obsolescent, models of religious identity in contemporary society require criticism and creativity - and, as evinced most powerfully in the Harry Potter stories, a flair for constructive engagement with paradox.  ...more"

Extracto: Harry Potter y el prisionero de Azkaban es la tercera pelicula de la serie Harry Potter y fue dirigida por el realizador mexicano Alfonso Cuaron. La pelicula se baso en novela homonima de la escritora J. K. Rowling y se estreno el 4 de junio de 2004, un ano y medio despues de haberse estrenado la pelicula anterior, Harry Potter y la camara secreta. El guion -a cargo de Steve Kloves- presenta una adaptacion de la novela que se tomo mas libertades que en el caso de las dos primeras peliculas de la serie. Este hecho provoco reacciones muy diversas entre los aficionados mas partidarios de una adaptacion fiel del texto literario. El largometraje presta una mayor atencion a la maduracion psicologica y sexual del trio protagonista y, segun la critica, presenta un tono mas oscuro y acorde con la historia del fugitivo Sirius Black, supuesto ferviente servidor del hombre que dejo sin familia a Harry Potter. A pesar de los cambios de tono, continuidad y elenco, El prisionero de Azkaban es, hasta el momento, una de las peliculas de la serie que mas criticas positivas ha conseguido. Ademas, la propia novelista declaro en su momento que El prisionero de Azkaban era su adaptacion favorita hasta la fecha. La duracion de la cinta -141 minutos- la convirtio en su momento en la mas breve de la serie, aun cuando la novela en que se basaba tenia una extension mayor a la de sus predecesoras.

E' quindi  Un libro che permette di comprendere interamente la saggezza delle fiabe che, da Chesterton a George MacDonald, da Lewis a Tolkien, e stata trasmessa anche alla Rowling.Negli ultimi anni, infatti, il genere fantasy si e imposto in maniera notevole all'attenzione del pubblico degli adolescenti, Tolkien e Lewis in testa e ovviamente il ""fenomeno Harry Potter"". E' quindi utile interrogarsi sul ruolo pedagogico che le opere di fantasy rivestono nella crescita dei ragazzi; in primo luogo si puo affermare che le favole assolvono una funzione di insegnamento morale ed etico e lo fanno senza mai essere esplicite, ma alludendo e divertendo. Dietro le avventure mirabolanti dei vari personaggi si intravede una visione antropologica dell'autrice, che descrive il contesto del mondo attuale portando il lettore da una visione di uomo individualista verso una visione di uomo guidato da valori morali, quali la scelta del bene, il dono, il sacrificio, l'amicizia, l'amore. Questo breve saggio visita i territori della fantasia di Hogwarts con il cuore e con la mente, facendone gustare al lettore timori e perplessita e aiutandoci a comprenderla interamente.  ...more"

Sophisticated readers know that the books are actually an extended wisdom parable, with characters who grow in profound ways. Harry, Hermione, and Ron are not heroes because of their magical abilities, but because they struggle against despair, adversity, and injustice in ways that fans connect with.Readers of all ages have loved these characters for years, but there is special wisdom in the books and films for those who have endured trauma and have struggled to heal from painful pasts. For them, Harry is a kindred spirit, rising above the cruelty he has survived by learning how to overcome his own pain.  Expecto Patronum offers insights from the Harry Potter parables for those who have struggled with trauma, depression, self-harm, loneliness, and self-doubt. It translates complicated psychological concepts about recovery from abuse, rape, and other betrayal traumas into terms that Potter fans can understand and apply personally.

In order to make that time crunch, filmmakers often have to combine or eliminate secondary characters, consolidate plot lines and sometimes change whole storylines. Inevitably, certain changes will not fit well with some fans, even while they are praised by others. Harry Potter certainly did not escape its share of outrage when book fans saw what had been done to their beloved world, and as the franchise is still hugely popular, debates still rage about what changes were good, bad or just plain bewildering.

Since Jesus is simply a historical figure for you, obviously nothing written here is applicable.Therefore, this book is written for Christians - and only for that category of Christians who are willing to consider the possibility that it may not be accurate to characterize Aslan as Jesus. If you are not one of these people, you will probably find this book upsetting - so you may find another book more suitable for you. ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" are superbly written stories of fiction that share some biblical truths, and it is certainly appropriate to point out the ways that Narnia relates to Bible truths. But IF someone points out the correlation with Biblical truths, it is equally important to reveal areas where the stories do NOT line up with the Word of God. Why is it that Christians become so resistant when they are asked to do this simple analysis for ""The Chronicles of Narnia?"" If the character of Aslan was presented only as a lion in a story, there would be no need for this book. In fact, it is fascinating that some people apparently do not know that C. S. Lewis called it ""pure moonshine"" that he sat down to write ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" as a Christian allegory. He said that ""at first there wasn't even anything Christian about them; that element pushed itself in of its own accord."" The problem is that for many Christians, Narnia is not just a set of fiction books about a talking lion. Instead, Narnia is a teaching tool with Aslan as an example of Jesus Christ. Although Aslan does many things that are verified by the Word of God, it is equally true that Aslan does many things that are contrary to what the Word of God says that Jesus said and did. The fact is that there are as many correlations to pagan beliefs and rituals in Narnia as there are to Bible truths. Is such a mixture to be ignored or excused or dismissed as irrelevant IF you are determined to view Aslan as a representation of Jesus Christ? Teresa Wilson examines each story in the Narnia Chronicles and exposes detail after detail of New Age philosophy and pagan rituals. She compares specific passages from Narnia with passages from the Bible to show how irreconcilable they are. She explains the reason that it is damaging to mix the images of Aslan with Jesus and that such a mixture creates confusion that opens doorways to deception. A Christian since she was 14, Teresa Wilson went through a period of time when she became a follower of the New Age movement. She eventually learned that she had been deceived and now shares what she learned with others. You may not agree with her when you begin this book, but perhaps, by the time you finish it, you will be persuaded at the very least to consider prayerfully what she has revealed. It is her hope that you will be willing to listen.  ...more"

Lewis's ""Chronicles of Narnia"" have long held a prominent place on many a child's (and adult's) bookshelf. Since their publication in the 195Os, the books' depiction of the fantasy land of Narnia has inspired the wonder, delight, and imaginations of children around the world. More than just fairy tales, the stories show readers that all is not as it seems, that perseverance can bring forth great rewards, and that growth is a continual and unpredictable process. Most important, arguably, is the ongoing struggle between good and evil depicted in the ""Chronicles."" These themes are displayed amid the experiences of several children, particularly Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter Pevensie. Beginning with the first book of the series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950), we follow the children as they magically enter the kingdom of Narnia for the first of many adventures there, including their meeting the memorable lion, Aslan. In the sequel, Prince Caspian, they help the prince and his army of Talking Beasts conquer the usurping Telemarines; the following novel, The Voyage of the ""Dawn Treader,"" continues Caspian's story by recounting his voyage to the End of the World. The fourth book, The Silver Chair, returns to the theme of an evil witch, first explored in The Lion, while The Horse and His Boy details Narnia's near-invasion by the Calormenes. The Magician's Nephew accounts for the creation of Narnia, and the seventh tale, The Last Battle (1956), tells of Narnia's final days. Colin Manlove has carefully studied the tales and shows that they are patterned narratives with many complex, intertwined threads. He relates these narratives to Lewis's views on stories, and also sets Lewis's books in their literary context, both juvenile and adult. After a discussion of the critical receptions of the tales, Manlove supplies a full chapter on each book for in-depth analysis.  ...more"

Children¡¯s literature depicting war, with children filling the roles of warrior heroes, serves not only to entertain and inspire, but also to help readers make meaningful connections between their own individuality and their culture, community, and circumstances. In ¡°Ghosts, Gremlins, and ¡®the War on Terror¡¯ in Children¡¯s Blitz Fiction,¡± Kristine Miller says, ¡°Because children bring to their reading a much less developed sense of either the self or its social communities than adult readers do, they need fiction not to shock and awaken them to possibilities but instead to teach them how to construct both personal and social identity in an unstable and war-torn world¡± (274). Such novels can assuage the trauma incurred through the child readers¡¯ firsthand experiences of warfare, or help alleviate the fear and confusion that lurk in the hearts of children exposed to violent conflict through more common means such as television.In The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis and the Harry Potter series from J.K. Rowling, tales of child warriors battling evil are set within a buffered fantasy world, creating a safe haven for child readers to explore, frame, and define their own fears. In ¡°On Fairy Stories,¡± J.R.R Tolkien claims that fairy stories allow children to set sail on an ¡°appointed journey¡± through which wisdom and dignity are gained by confrontations with ¡°peril, sorrow, and the shadow of death¡± (67). The Chronicles of Narnia and the Harry Potter series take child readers on just such an ¡°appointed journey,¡± bringing them face to face with violence and bloodshed perpetrated by not only by villains, but by child characters in the fantasy worlds of Narnia and Hogwarts, where children are considered worthy and capable of becoming warriors who battle the forces of evil. In these novels, child characters are driven by the knowledge that only they can save their worlds from destruction, and because they are placed in positions of authority and leadership, their examples ultimately offer the possibility of empowerment to child readers lost in feelings of helplessness in the real world.  ...more"

They were small reptilian creatures with parrot-like heads. They average about a foot in height. True to their name, Ankle Slicers brought down their enemies by slicing through their ankles with sharp scythes. Notably in the film, they were responsible for cutting down a charging rhinoceros. Popplewell, eldest of three children, is the daughter of Andrew Popplewell and Dr. Debra Lomas.

The now vastly popular Chronicles are a widely known testament to the religious and moral principles that Lewis embraced in his later life. What many readers and viewers do not know about the Chronicles is that a close reading of the seven-book series reveals the strikingly effective influences of literary sources as diverse as George MacDonald's fantastic fiction and the courtly love poetry of the High Middle Ages. Arguably the two most influential sources for the series are Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queen and John Milton's Paradise Lost. Lewis was so personally intrigued by these two particular pieces of literature that he became renowned for his scholarly studies of both Milton and Spenser. This book examines the important ways in which Lewis so clearly echoes The Faerie Queen and Paradise Lost, and how the elements of each work together to convey similar meanings. Most specifically, the chapters focus on the telling interweavings that can be seen in the depiction of evil, female characters, fantastic and symbolic landscapes and settings, and the spiritual concepts so personally important to C.S.

Excerpt: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the soundtrack of the film of the same name. Harry Gregson-Williams composed the soundtrack, which was released on December 13, 2005 (see 2005 in music). Gregson-Williams was the first composer who director Andrew Adamson approached for the film because they had worked together on Shrek (2001) and Shrek 2 (2004). Because Adamson had to shoot the film in New Zealand for an extended period and Gregson-Williams was working on scores for films such as Kingdom of Heaven, he initially only prepared for the project by re-reading the book and reading the film script. It wasn't until he saw the first cut of the film that, as he put it, ""I could see the look of it, the look of the characters. I found that what I felt emotionally, when compared to the book, was quite different and it was then at that point that I could really 'get under the skin' of the project."" He said that although re-reading the book helped him enter ""that headspace,"" the script also provided ""a lot of good information"" because it included several scenes that weren't in the book.

Excerpt: Ankle Slicers were creatures invented for the Disney film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and did not appear in Lewis's works. They were small reptilian creatures with parrot-like heads. They average about a foot in height. True to their name, Ankle Slicers brought down their enemies by slicing through their ankles with sharp scythes. Notably in the film, they were responsible for cutting down a charging rhinoceros. Apes are primates similar to those in our world. Apes come in different shapes and sizes, but the type of apes weren't mentioned in the book. They are known to have a passion for oranges and bananas (so much that one ape named Shift used it as an excuse for taking over Narnia). They also love nuts. Apes are generally clever, sneaky animals, being able to do many things Humans can (because of their man-like fingers). During the Winter Revolution, there are some apes that were on the side of Aslan and some that are on the side of Jadis. The Assassination Attempt on King Caspian X of Narnia was the spontaneous attack led by the Dwarf traitor Nikabrik, on the to-be-king's life at Aslan's How.

The story that takes place within the seven books possesses something that is  Master's Thesis from the year 2017 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1,8, University of Leipzig (Institute for Anglistics), language: English, abstract: The Chronicles of Narnia attract not only children, but also readers past the childhood age group. The story that takes place within the seven books possesses something that is explained by Lewis<U+FFFD>s favourite childhood author Robert Louis Stevenson as ""nameless longings"". According to him, the stories, apart from containing realities of life, should provide the reader with something that makes them want more even after the book has come to its end. The main aim of the thesis is to give some of the nameless longings a proper name. The first part is dedicated to analysis of the Chronicles on the basis of Joseph Campbell<U+FFFD>s approach to mythology and C.G. Jung<U+FFFD>s analysis of archetypes to demonstrate that Lewis<U+FFFD>s way of combining different views into one story corresponds with Campbell's theory of Monomyth. The second part addresses Lewis<U+FFFD>s own view on mythology and what makes a good myth in accordance with his checklist in An Experiment in Criticism. Additionally, the second part attempts to clarify that Lewis did not draw from the world<U+FFFD>s mythology only; the story is also based on a collection of Narnia<U+FFFD>s own myths that are passed down throughout its history. The third and the final part of the thesis looks at the Chronicles from the point of view of the Christian myth and the idea that religious myths in general follow a common pattern of a saviour sacrificing himself for the believers in order to save the world from the evil. Furthermore, Lewis<U+FFFD>s own views on religion and its influence on writing the Chronicles are discussed.  ...more"

Lewis is best known for his numerous literary masterpieces and his role as a Christian apologist. Lewiss career has touched peoples lives and attracted criticism in equal parts. From the stances he takes in his novellas to his approach to interpreting the Bible, much of Lewis's fame has come as a result of ruffling feathers with his incredible talent. Anyone who reads will have heard of Lewis's most famous novels, The Chronicles of Narnia. The series of seven fantasy books is what earned Lewis his reputation as a talented author. However, critics have accused Lewis of conforming to gender and racial stereotypes in the series. Despite these controversies, some of the novels have made into successful films. Aside from writing novels that appeal to children, Lewis also wrote a series of rather dark poems. As a far cry from his books that featured plucky heroes and heroines, Lewis's poems focused on morality and death. In ""After Prayers, Lie Cold,"" which opens with ""Arise my body, my small body, we have striven,"" Lewis addresses death and nature. EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK Lewis may be best known for The Chronicles of Narnia, but he also gained fame through publishing other fictional masterpieces. The Space Trilogy steps away from Lewis usual themes of myths and magic, and instead focuses on what life may be like on other planets. The series begins with Out of the Silent Planet, which is set on Mars. The main character, Elwin, discovers that Earth has been banished by all of the other planets, and exists in solitude within the solar system. This was then followed by Perelandra, which is primarily set on Venus, where humans have just begun to live. Finally, the series ends with The Hideous Strength, a book that features a battle against demons who want to lay waste to Earth. Throughout the books, the old solar system and cosmology are featured, as well as secret languages. Lewis Mere Christianity is a series of radio interviews that Lewis gave on Christianity that were published as transcripts. In this book, Lewis attempts to argue for Christian morals. At the time of the interviews, Europe was battling against Hitler and Nazism, and Lewis used Hitler as a point of reference for what the majority of humans would perceive to be morally wrong. The book also tackles the rather controversial topic of how Jesus is depicted in the Bible. Lewis made notes of parts of the Bible where Jesus would apparently claim to be God, and tried to encourage Christians to question why he did this. By invoking heated debates on how Jesus Christ saw himself, Lewis attracted criticism from staunch religious theists. Finally, Lewis's arguments for Christianity placed a certain degree of focus on how Christians should lead their lives, including their approach to marriage, sex and sins such as pride.

Petikan: The Lord of the Rings atau Penguasa Cincin merupakan karya epik fantasi karangan pengarang berbangsa British iaitu J. R. R. Tolkien. Kisahnya bermula dengan sebuah sekuel sebelumnya iaitu buku fantasi The Hobbit, tetapi kemudian dikembangkan menjadi cerita yang lebih panjang. Ia ditulis antara tahun 1937 dan 1949, yang kebanyakannya ditulis ketika Perang Dunia Kedua. Ia diterbitkan dalam tiga jilid pada 1954 dan 1955, dan telah dicetak berkali-kali dan diterjemahkan kepada banyak bahasa. Berkemungkinan, karya tersebut adalah hasil sastera yang paling terkenal dalam abad kedua puluh. Muka hadapan buku oleh TolkienAksi dalam The Lord of the Rings digambarkan sebagai dunia atau Bumi sebenar dan didiami manusia dengan tambahan rekaan makhluk pada zaman yang direka juga. Tolkien menamakannya dalam Bahasa Inggeris moden, Middle-earth (Bumi-Tengah), merujuk kepada bahasa Inggeris kuno iaitu Midgard/Middangeard. Kisah tersebut berkaitan dengan pelbagai kaum seperti Hobbit, Elf, Manusia, Orang Kerdil dan Ahli Sihir, dan bertumpukan kepada Cincin Kuasa yang dibuat oleh Raja Kegelapan Sauron.

Excerpt: Alicia Borrachero was the actor who played Queen Prunaprismia in the Prince Caspian movie. Popplewell, eldest of three children, is the daughter of Andrew Popplewell and Dr. Debra Lomas. She has two younger siblings, Lulu Popplewell, who is also an actress, and Freddie Popplewell who starred as Michael Darling in the movie Peter Pan. She attended North London Collegiate School and was Head Girl 2006-2007. Since 2007, Popplewell has been a student of English at Magdalen Collage, Oxford. Popplewell currently resides in Highbury, North London. Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie in The Chronicles Of Narnia Popplewell began acting at the age of six. Her acting career includes: Frenchman's Creek, Mansfield Park, The Little Vampire and The Girl with a Pearl Earring. Her first major role was in the film The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. She has a phobia of mice, which required a double to do part of her scene at the Stone Table in the film. She reprised her role in the sequel, Prince Caspian. The movie opened in theatres 16 May 2008. Since then, university life has kept her busy and she hasn't made another movie in nearly two years. She did however, appear in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which was released in December 2010, but her character was only a cameo. It remains unclear when Anna will next appear either on film or on TV. She was confirmed as Sophie in the 2011 film Hanna, but she was replaced with Jessica ...  ...more"

Excerpt: Talking bears of the world of Narnia were large, gentle, child-like creatures. A Bear was traditionally one of the Marshals of the Lists. They are depicted as strong but gentle creatures, who pass their time napping and eating honey. One prominent family of bears are the Bulgy Bears, the elder of which is known to suck his paw at inopportune moments. They are very wise and intelligent ones that are very noble and loyal to Aslan. Black Bears were black colored ones that were loyal and noble to Aslan. They only appeared in the Disney A Black Bear Chasing Lucy adaption films. In the 2005 film of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, black bears suffered the terrible Long Winter when they traveled to Aslan's camp near the Stone Table. After the Age of Winter was ending, black bears fought in Aslan's Army in the First Battle of Beruna against the White Witch's Army where one fought a Wolf and another fought a White Tiger.In the 2008 film of Prince Caspian, one black bear was seen when Lucy though...  ...more"

Excerpt: Ankle Slicers were creatures invented for the Disney film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and did not appear in Lewis's works. They were small reptilian creatures with parrot-like heads. They average about a foot in height. True to their name, Ankle Slicers brought down their enemies by slicing through their ankles with sharp scythes. Notably in the film, they were responsible for cutting down a charging rhinoceros. Apes are primates similar to those in our world. Apes come in different shapes and sizes, but the type of apes weren't mentioned in the book. They are known to have a passion for oranges and bananas (so much that one ape named Shift used it as an excuse for taking over Narnia). They also love nuts. Apes are generally clever, sneaky animals, being able to do many things Humans can (because of their man-like fingers). During the Winter Revolution, there are some apes that were on the side of Aslan and some that are on the side of Jadis. Shortly after the creation of Narnia by Aslan, a badger was among the creatures that caught Andrew Ketterley. Other animals thought that Andrew was a tree. The badger did not believe that and had the idea that he was...  ...more"

Anvard was also apparently the location of most of the Archenlander population. Anvard was probably founded sometime in the late second or early third centuries. In 1014 the Battle of Anvard, the primary battle of the Archenland Conflict, was fought before its gates. Famous kings who ruled from Anvard included Lune, Cor and his Queen Aravis, and Ram the Great. The castle was famous for its many towers and lack of a moat. It was made of red-brown stones and sat on green lawns in front of a high woody ridge to the north. There were extensive dog kennels in ...  ...more"

Excerpt: Ahoshta Tarkaan was a Calormene Tarkaan (lord) and Grand Vizier. Ahoshta managed to climb the social ladder of Calormen (not an easy task) through (according to Aravis) flattery and evil advice. Of ""base birth"" (i.e., a commoner), he rose to being a Tarkaan and, being very close to the Tisroc he was appointed Grand Vizier after the death of Axartha Tarkaan, the previous advisor. He met with the Tisroc in a meeting, where he was portrayed as groveling and sycophantic, bowing completely prostrate before the king and accepting kicks in the rump by the uppity Prince Rabadash. Ahoshta was engaged to the Tarkheena Aravis in the manner of arranged marriage, an event which she claimed was part of a plot by her wicked stepmother to get rid of her husband's child. Aravis, however, hated Ahoshta, for several reasons: his low birth, his apelike face, and his plotting and trickery. In addition he was about sixty, while she was much younger (while her age is never explicitly stated, she cannot be more than a teenager, if not younger). As a result she fled from Calormen for Narnia, along with Hwin, her mare who was actually a Talking Horse. After she and her friend Lasaraleen saw him before the Tisroc the latter tried to point out to Aravis her fiance's importance, but Aravis found him even less appealing, openly criticizing him for groveling like a slave before seeking revenge by encouraging the Tisroc to plot his son's death.

She eventually came to live in Archenland, married its Prince Cor, and became Archenland's queen. The only daughter of Kidrash Tarkaan, Aravis spent her youth in the heart of Calormen. When we first meent her in the books, her mother and older brother have both died and her father recently married an unkind woman, who made no attempt to disguise her dislike for Aravis. Aravis's already difficult home life was rendered impossible when her father announced her engagement to her uncle, Ahoshta Tarkaan, an ugly, loathsome man whom she despised. Feeling she had no other option, she decided to commit suicide. However her attempt on her own life was interrupted when her horse Hwin began to speak, saying this Taken aback on hearing the horse's pleas, Aravis thought she was now suffering delusions due her fear of death. Ashamed, she attempted to stab herself again, only to have Hwin rebuke her once more, placing her own head between the girl and the dagger, and this time Aravis was so curious that she forgot about killing herself.

Excerpt: Narnia is a fantasy world created by C. S. Lewis as the primary location for his series of seven fantasy novels for children, The Chronicles of Narnia. The world is so called after the country of Narnia, in which much of the action of the Chronicles takes place. In Narnia, some animals can talk, mythical beasts abound, and magic is common. The series tracks the story of Narnia when humans, usually children, enter the Narnian world from 'our world', or Earth. The country of Narnia is where most of the action of the series is set. According to the mythology of the series, Narnia was created by the great lion, Aslan, and is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures. C. S. Lewis may have taken the name from the Italian town of Narni, whose Latin name was in fact Narnia. Narnia features rolling hills rising into low mountains to the south, and is predominantly forested except for marshlands in the north. The region is bordered on the east by the Eastern Ocean, on the west by a great mountain range, on the north by the River Shribble, and on the south by Archenland. The Great River of Narnia enters the country from the northwest and flows to the Eastern Ocean. At its mouth lies Cair Paravel, the seat of High King Peter and his siblings. Other communities along the river include, from east to west, Beruna, Beaversdam, and Chippingford. Archenland is a mountainous country south of Narnia. It is bordered on the north by Narnia and on the south by the Winding Arrow river. The seat of government is at Anvard, in the heart of the country. ...  ...more"

Ia adalah satu-satunya tokoh yang muncul di ketujuh buku Narnia. Aslan digambarkan sebagai makhluk yang bijak dan penuh kasih sayang. Selain itu ia adalah makhluk yang misterius dan penuh kekuatan yang menjaga dan menyelamatkan Narnia. Sepanjang alur cerita, Aslan dikisahkan sebagai makhluk yang menciptakan dan menghancurkan dunia, termasuk dunia Narnia. Menurut penulisnya, C. S. Lewis, Aslan adalah gambaran lain dari Kristus, jikalau Kristus muncul dalam dunia fantasi. Aslan muncul pertama kali dalam penciptaan dunia Narnia. Ketika Digory, Polly, Jadis, Paman Andrew, Frank dan kudanya, Strawberry, tanpa sengaja masuk ke dunia baru dengan cincin ajaib, mereka menemukan dunia tersebut kosong. Lalu Aslan muncul dan dengan kekuatan nyanyiannya, Aslan membuat dunia Narnia menjadi ada. Ketika Digory, Polly dan Frank langsung terkagum-kagum akan Aslan, Jadis langsung menunjukkan sikap takut dan benci. Ia mencoba menyerang Aslan dengan tiang besi sebelum kabur.

Excerpt: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an action-adventure game released in 2005 by Traveller's Tales. The game is based on the novel-adapted movie of the same name. It was released in November before the movie for most major consoles including the GameCube, PC, Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, and Game Boy Advance. Also in 2005, an RPG with an identical name was released for wireless phone systems by Disney Mobile. As you move through the game, you'll collect coins that can be used to purchase special moves and items. Your collection will grow the further you get through the game. Items available for purchase include the ability to tame different animals, increase your health, do double damage, and more. These are necessary at some parts in the game. An additional challenge to the game is the Bonus Shields. Each level will have a set amount of bonus shields, and as you replay the levels, you can try to find them to get 100% on the game. Some levels will have as little as 5, while others will have over 20. Another challenge is to find the statues. This is best to do while you are doing the game the first time through. When you collect a statue, it marks it for Aslan the Lion, who can turn it back to life. The more statues you collect, the more reinforcements you'll have in the final Great Battle. If you lose all of your life, the game will automatically set you back at the last checkpoint you passed. If you have passed no checkpoints, you will restart at the beginning of the level.

Fue dirigida por el neozelandes Martin Campbell y estrenada en 2006. Es la primera cinta de la franquicia que cuenta con Daniel Craig para el papel protagonista del agente 007, asi como la tercera adaptacion de Casino Royale (la primera version se estreno en 1954 y la segunda, en 1967). La trama aborda los comienzos de James Bond como agente 007, justo despues de haber obtenido su licencia para matar. Tras prevenir un ataque terrorista en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Miami, Bond se enamora de Vesper Lynd, una agente de Her Majesty's Treasury asignada para proporcionarle los fondos monetarios necesarios para frustrar un torneo de poquer de altas apuestas organizado por Le Chiffre. La historia continua en Quantum of Solace, el vigesimo segundo filme de la serie. El guion fue redactado por Neal Purvis, Robert Wade y Paul Haggis, encargandose este ultimo de reescribir el climax del relato. El reparto principal estuvo integrado por Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench, Jeffrey Wright y Giancarlo Giannini. A comienzos de 2005, tras la produccion de Die Another Day, Pierce Brosnan anuncio que ya no volveria a interpretar a Bond debido a que, por ese entonces, contaba con 50 anos de edad, razon por la cual los productores querian reemplazarlo por un actor mas jove...  ...more"

Excerpt: Andrew Ketterley was a magician living in London around 1900. He was the uncle of Digory Kirke, and one of the first humans to set foot in Narnia. Andrew was born around 1840 in England to the Ketterly family, a 'very old Dorsetshire family'. He had two sisters; Letitia and Mabel Ketterley. Andrew's godmother was a woman known as Mrs. Lefay, and although he was very fond of her, he was not encouraged to see her, as she was viewed to be insane. Mrs. Lefay openly claimed to be a fairy and told her son that she knew of the existence of other worlds. In time, the two were separated when she was sent to prison. Also, Andrew was was asked to come to see Mrs. Lefay in her last days. Before dying, she gave to him a box of magical origin, which she made him swear to burn with certain (probably magical) ceremonies. Though Andrew swore, he did not keep his promise.Instead, he embarked on a long career in magic. Knowing the box and it's contents to be of magical origin, Andrew set out to discover the use to contents of the box. This search took him most of his adult life. During this time, Andrew apparently had no career, and instead preferred to live off the charity of his sister Letitia. He also searched and researched forms of magic, and eventually became quite an adept 'magician'. After years he discovered the box to be from the island of Atlantis. Inside it was dust from another world. Upon discovering this, Andrew began to work at using the dust to...  ...more"

Excerpt: Alberta Scrubb was the wife of Harold Scrubb and the mother to Eustace Scrubb. Alberta and Harold Scrubb were very progressive people. They were non-smokers, teetotalers (non-alcoholics), vegetarians, pacifists, and republicans. In 1933, they had a son, Eustace Clarence, whom they raised to be as they were. Alberta appeared to have been the true head of the family, rather than Harold. The family made their home in Cambridge. Later, in 1942, Alberta and Harold took in their nephew and neice Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, whilst the children's parents were abroad in America. Alberta is known to dislike all the Pevensie children, who were her relatives. When Eustace began to behave as they did, and become a kinder, better boy in the eyes of most, Alberta began to complain that it was their influence. In 1949, Alberta and Harold suffered the loss of their only son, Eustace, in a train accident. He was then 16. Anne Feathertone was a schoolmate of Lucy's during in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. She was jealous of Lucy's friendship with Marjorie Preston. Lucy overhears (via magic), a conversation between Anne and Marjorie in which Anne scolds her for befriending Lucy.

S. Lewis. It is considered a classic of children's literature and is the author's best-known work, having sold over 100 million copies in 47 languages.[1][2] Written by Lewis, illustrated by Pauline Baynes, Chris Van Allsburg in 1978, and Leo and Diane Dillon in 1994, and originally published in London between 1950 and 1956, The Chronicles of Narnia has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for radio, television, the stage, and film. Set in the fictional realm of Narnia, a fantasy world of magic, mythical beasts, and talking animals, the series narrates the adventures of various children who play central roles in the unfolding history of that world. Except in The Horse and His Boy, the protagonists are all children from the real world, magically transported to Narnia, where they are called upon by the lion Aslan to protect Narnia from evil and restore the throne to its rightful line. The books span the entire history of Narnia, from its creation in The Magician's Nephew to its eventual destruction in The Last Battle. Inspiration for the series was taken from multiple sources; in addition to adapting numerous traditional Christian themes, Lewis freely borrowed characters and ideas from Greek and Roman mythology as well as from traditional British and Irish fairy tales. The books have profoundly influenced adult and children's fantasy literature since World War II. Lewis's exploration of themes not usually present in children's literature, such as religion, as well as the books' perceived treatment of issues including race and gender, has caused some controversy.

He is known to fight with a standard Minotaur axe, and seems to wear little armor.

S. Lewis, fantasy novelist, literary scholar, and Christian apologist, is one of the most original and well-known literary figures of the twentieth century. As one who stood at the crossroads of Edwardian and modern thinking, he is often read as a sexist or even misogynistic man of his time, but this fresh rereading assesses Lewis as a prescient thinker who transformed typical Western gender paradigms. The Feminine Ethos in C. S. Lewis's 'Chronicles of Narnia' proposes that Lewis's highly nuanced metaphorical view of gender relations has been misunderstood precisely because it challenges Western chauvinist assumptions on sex and gender. Instead of perpetuating sexism, Lewis subverts the culturally inherited chauvinism of <U+FFFD>masculine<U+FFFD> classical heroism with the biblically inspired vision of a surprisingly <U+FFFD>feminine<U+FFFD> spiritual heroism. His view that we are all <U+FFFD>feminine<U+FFFD> in relation to the <U+FFFD>masculine<U+FFFD> God - a theological feminism that crosses gender lines - means that qualities we tend to consider to be feminine, such as humility, are the qualities essential to being fully human. This book's theoretical framework is Lewis's own, grounded in his view of biblical thinking, as he was informed by writers such as Milton, Wordsworth, and George MacDonald, and in terms of the uniquely progressive implications for twentieth-first century cultural studies. This highly insightful and entertaining study of theological feminism in Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia will be compelling for anyone interested in children's and fantasy literature, Inklings scholarship, gender discourse, ethical and spiritual discourse, literature and theology, and cultural studies in general.  ...more"

This book follows the long halt in the darkness of the Mines of Moria (which ended The Return of the Shadow) and traces the tale into new lands south and east of the Misty Mountains. Tolkien introduces us to Lothlorien, land of the elves, where we meet the Ents, the Riders of Rohan, and Saruman the White in the fortress of Isengard. In brief outlines and penciled drafts dashed down on scraps of paper are the first entry of Galadriel; the earliest ides of the history of Gondor; and the original meeting of Aragorn with Eowyn, its significance destined to be wholly transformed. Conceptions of what lay ahead dissolve as the story takes its own paths, as in the account of the capture of Frodo and his rescue by Sam Gamgee from Minas Morgul, written long before J.R.R. Tolkien actually reached that point in the writing of The Lord of the Rings. A chief feature of the book is a full account of the original Map, with drawings of successive phases, which was long the basis and accompaniment of the emerging geography of Middle-earth.

In The Return of the Shadow (an abandoned title for the first volume) Christopher Tolkien describes, with full citation of the earliest notes, outline plans, and narrative drafts, the intricate evolution of The Fellowship of the Ring and the gradual emergence of the conceptions that transformed what J.R.R. Tolkien for long believed would be a far shorter book, 'a sequel to The Hobbit'. The enlargement of Bilbo's 'magic ring' into the supremely potent and dangerous Ruling Ring of the Dark Lord is traced and the precise moment is seen when, in an astonishing and unforeseen leap in the earliest narrative, a Black Rider first rode into the Shire, his significance still unknown. The character of the hobbit called Trotter (afterwards Strider or Aragorn) is developed while his indentity remains an absolute puzzle, and the suspicion only very slowly becomes certainty that he must after all be a Man. The hobbits, Frodo's companions, undergo intricate permutations of name and personality, and other major figures appear in strange modes: a sinister Treebeard, in league with the Enemy, a ferocious and malevolent Farmer Maggot. The story in this book ends at the point where J.R.R. Tolkien halted in the story for a long time, as the Company of the Ring, still lacking Legolas and Gimli, stood before the tomb of Balin in the Mines of Moria.

It was among the earliest full-length critical works devoted to Tolkien's fantasies, the 1st to set his writings in their proper context in the history of fantasy. It  Tolkien: A Look Behind The Lord of the Rings is a study of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien written by Lin Carter. It was 1st published in paper by Ballantine in 3/69 & went thru numerous additional printings. It was among the earliest full-length critical works devoted to Tolkien's fantasies, the 1st to set his writings in their proper context in the history of fantasy. It was the earliest of three studies by Carter devoted to fantasy/horror writers & the history of fantasy, being followed by Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos ('72) & Imaginary Worlds: The Art of Fantasy ('73), establishing him as an authority on the genre, indirectly leading to his editorial guidance of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series. Gollancz published a cloth edition updated by Adam Roberts in 8/03. The study serves as an introduction for those unfamiliar with Tolkien's work. An introduction briefly reviews the publishing phenomenon of The Lord of the Rings & its popularity in the wake of the 1st paper editions in the '60s, after which he devotes three chapters to a short biography of the author thru the late '60s, including an account of how it was written. Four chapters explaining Middle-earth & summarizing the stories of The Hobbit & the three volumes of The Lord of the Rings follow, for the benefit of readers who may not have actually read the works. Carter next turns to the question of what the works are, a point of some confusion at the time. The then-current vogue for realistic fiction provided critics with few tools for evaluating an out-&-out fantasy on its own terms. Attempts to deconstruct it as a satire or allegory were rife. Carter firmly debunks these efforts, supporting his argument by drawing on Tolkien's own published ruminations on fantasy's functions & purposes. He then contextualizes the works by sketching the history of written fantasy from its earliest appearance in the epic poetry of the ancient world thru the heroic poetry of the Dark & the prose romances of the Middle Ages, down to the fairy tales, ghost stories & gothic novels of the early modern era & the rediscovery of the genre by writers of the 19-20th centuries prior to & contemporary with Tolkien. The origins of the modern genre are discovered in the writings of Wm Morris, Lord Dunsany & E.R. Eddison & followed thru the works of authors they influenced, including H.P. Lovecraft, Fletcher Pratt, L. Sprague de Camp & Mervyn Peake. Carter next highlights some of Tolkien's particular debts to his predecessors, tracing the motifs & names he utilizes back to their beginnings in Norse mythology & highlighting other echoes in his work deriving from legend & history. Finally noted is Tolkien's influence on contemporary fantasy, which was just beginning to make itself felt, primarily in the juvenile fantasies of Carol Kendall, Alan Garner & Lloyd Alexander.  ...more"

But can he do so when the Lidless Eye of the Lord of the Rings watches the land tirelessly in search of his precious weapon? Summary of the Book Long ago, in Eregion, the Elves forged the Rings of Power. Three they kept for themselves, to safeguard their havens. Seven they gave unto the Dwarves, so that they could use that power to mine the world to their will. Nine, oh, those nine they trusted into the hands of the Kings of Men, thinking that they'd be safe, that they'd be worth trusting. They believed that there were no more Rings. They believed that the genius who gave them the direction to create the Rings, was one of them. They were wrong. The Dark Lord, Sauron, for that is who that man in the shadows was, crafted a master Ring, the One Ring to Bring Them All and In the Darkness, Bind Them. In a great battle, they defeated him with the might of Isildur, King of Men. However, the One Ring was soon lost, and thought lost forever. Like all Fell Things, it was to return. And with it, would return the Dark Lord to his Dark Throne. Unless, of course, a company of Men, Elves and Dwarfs were to stop him. Unless, of course, one lonely Hobbit could find a way to cast the Ring into the fires from whence it came. About J. R. R.

The  This brand new full-colour art book reveals in sumptuous detail more than 100 paintings based on The Lord of the Rings by acclaimed Dutch artist, Cor Blok, many of which appear here for the first time. Fifty years ago, shortly after The Lord of the Rings was first published, Cor Blok read the work and was completely captivated by its invention and epic storytelling. The breadth of imagination and powerful imagery inspired the young Dutch artist, and this spark of enthusiasm, coupled with his desire to create art that resembled a historical artefact in its own right, led to the creation of more than 100 paintings. Following an exhibition at the Hague in 1961, JRR Tolkien's publisher, Rayner Unwin, sent him five pictures. Tolkien was so taken with them that he met and corresponded with the artist and even bought some paintings for himself. The series bears comparison with the Bayeux Tapestry, in which each tells an epic and complex story in deceptively simple style, but beneath this simplicity lies a compelling and powerful language of form that becomes more effective as the sequence of paintings unfolds. The full-colour paintings in this new book are presented in story order so that the reader can enjoy them as the artist intended. They are accompanied by extracts from The Lord of the Rings and the artist also provides an extensive introduction illuminating the creation of the series and notes to accompany some of the major compositions. Many of the paintings appear for the very first time. Readers will find Cor Blok's work refreshing, provocative, charming and wholly memorable -- the bold and expressive style that he created stands as a unique achievement in the history of fantasy illustration. Rarely has an artist captured the essence of a writer's work in such singular fashion; the author found much to admire in Cor Blok's work, and what higher accolade is there?  ...more"

Frodo guides us as well, as he makes his torturous journey to Mount Doom and endures the Ring's unceasing temptations. With him, we see that sometimes we overcome our temptations, and at other times they overwhelm us. We also learn, as he and Boromir do, to get back up and start the struggle anew. Sam shows us the height of hope and the depth of devotion. In fact, everyone in the tale, good as well as evil, has something to teach us.Anne Marie Gazzolo hopes that you will find inspiration within to apply to your life.  ...more"

From popular to scholarly literature, the women and smaller characters often go overlooked. But our notions of what makes a hero have altered since September 11, and sometimes the most unlikely people can come to embody all that we look up to and admire in a person. Here, Lynnette Porter examines what we mean when we talk about heroes, and for the first time illustrates the heroic qualities that can be found in the women and other beloved, though less-celebrated, characters in the ""The Lord of the RingS"" books and movies. She takes a critical look at the importance of literary and cinematic heroes in general, emphasizing the roles of Merry, Pippin, Galadriel, Eowyn, Arwen, Legolas, and Gimli, who can all be considered heroes despite their relatively smaller roles. She shows, ultimately, that our attraction to and celebration of heroes does not have to be limited to the leading man, but rather that women and youth often display essential characteristics of true heroes.Bringing together a discussion of both the books and the movies, Porter reveals for readers the heroic nature of several characters in ""The Lord of the RingS"" who have been ignored in terms of their status as heroes. Nevertheless, these female and youthful characters have received incredible popular acclaim and illustrate the shift in the way the Western movie-going public identifies and glorifies heroes. While other stars may have outshone the likes of Merry and Pippin, Arwen and Galadriel, Porter redirects the spotlight on these favorites of the books and movies to show us how the roles they play, the actions they take, and the behaviors they display are worthy of our praise and admiration. This unique and refreshing perspective adds dimension to our understanding of ""The Lord of the RingS"" phenomenon.  ...more"

Tolkien famously stated that the real theme of The Lord of the Rings was ""Death and Immortality."" The deaths that underscore so much of the subject matter of Tolkien's masterpiece have a great deal to teach us. From the heroic to the humble, Tolkien draws on medieval concepts of death and dying to explore the glory and sorrow of human mortality. Three great themes of death link medieval Northern European culture, The Lord of the Rings, and contemporary culture: the way in which we die, the need to remember the dead, and above all the lingering apprehension of what happens after death. Like our medieval ancestors, we still talk about what it means to die as a hero, a traitor, or a coward; we still make decisions about ways to honor and remember the departed; and we continue to seek to appease and contain the dead. These themes suggest a latent resonance between medieval and modern cultures and raise an issue not generally discussed in contemporary Western society: our deeply rooted belief that how one dies in some way matters.While Tolkien, as a medieval scholar, naturally draws much of his inspiration from the literature, folklore, and legends of the Middle Ages, the popularity of his work affirms that modern audiences continue to find these tropes relevant and useful. From ideas of ""good"" and ""bad"" deaths to proper commemoration and disposal of the dead, and even to ghost stories, real people find comfort in the ideas about death and dying that Tolkien explores.""The Sweet and the Bitter"": Death and Dying in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings examines the ways in which Tolkien's masterwork makes visible the connections between medieval and modern conceptions of dying and analyzes how contemporary readers use The Lord of the Rings as a tool for dealing with death.  ...more"

Abyssinia.Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia) was an ancient Christian Empire that was one of the world's four greatest powers after the time of Christ, but it became isolated by the rise of Islam. Besieged in its highland fortress, it became a land untouched by the passage of time. It survived as the only part of Africa that was not colonized by European powers, and became internationally prominent in the years immediately prior to Tolkien's writing because of the Italian war in 1935.

Similarly, although public concern for the environment is widespread and ¡°going green¡± has never been trendier, ecocriticism is also an underserved area of literary studies. Arda Inhabited fills a gap in both areas by combining ecocritical and broader postmodern concerns with the growing appreciation for Tolkien¡¯s Middle-Earth. Susan Jeffers looks at the way different groups and individuals in The Lord of the Rings interact with their environments. Drawing substantially on ecocritical theory, she argues that there are three main ways these groups relate to their setting: ¡°power with,¡± ¡°power from,¡± and ¡°power over.¡± Ents, Hobbits, and Elves have ¡°power with¡± their environments. Dwarves and Men draw ¡°power from¡± their place, interacting with the world symbolically or dialectically. Sauron, Saruman, and Orcs all stand as examples of narcissistic solipsism that attempts to exercise ¡°power over¡± the environment. Jeffers further considers how wanderers in Middle-Earth interact with the world in light of these three categories and examines how these relationships reflect Tolkien¡¯s own moral paradigm. Arda Inhabited responds to environmental critics such as Neil Evernden and Christopher Manes, as well as to other touchstones of postmodern thought such as Hegel, DeSaussure, Adorno, and Deleuze and Guattari. It blends their ideas with the analyses of Tolkien scholars such as Patrick Curry, Verlyn Flieger, and Tom Shippey and builds on the work of other scholars who have looked at environment and Tolkien such as Matthew Dickerson and Jonathan Evans. Arda Inhabited demonstrates how Tolkien studies enhances ecocriticism with a fresh examination of interconnection and environment, and ecocriticism enriches Tolkien studies with new ways of reading his work.  ...more"

Tolkien published one of the fantasy genre¡¯s seminal works with The Hobbit, which delighted adults and children alike telling an adventurous tale about hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who leaves the cozy comforts of his home to try to win a share of a treasure guarded by a dragon named Smaug. The popularity of the book made his publisher and audience want a follow-up involving his Middle Earth and hobbit creations.To say Tolkien outdid himself in response would be a drastic understatement. What followed was the most famous trilogy of the fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien drew upon his background and spent over a decade fashioning the history of his world and the characters, including some of the old (Gandalf and Bilbo) and a lot of the new (Frodo, Aragorn, Sam). Though Tolkien¡¯s epic fantasy was published more than 50 years ago, it remains a stalwart piece of writing today. More than 150 million copies have been sold in more than 30 languages, and the trilogy is among the top-selling novels of all time. Like The Hobbit, Tolkien¡¯s expertise with language and history inform the story, but The Lord of the Rings is a staggering, complex work for adults, not children. Tolkien took the themes from The Hobbit and revisited them, but this time he went even deeper. The corruptive nature of power and the many forms of bravery are once again front and center as major themes. Working together and the environmental degradation of industrialization and war are also themes woven through the work. Although the fantasy element of The Lord of the Rings is undeniable, it is the human story at the center that truly draws readers in. It is a story of people<U+2014>whether they be dwarves or elves or hobbits<U+2014>who bravely stand up to evil in an effort to make their world a better place. That central story resonates and will continue to resonate.

He set out only to write a good story, the kind of story he and his friends would enjoy reading. In The Hobbit and in The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien created an entire world informed by his vast knowledge of mythology, languages, and medieval literature. In the 1960s, his books unexpectedly gained cult status with a new generation of young, countercultural readers. Today, the readership for Tolkien's absorbing secondary world--filled with monsters, magic, adventure, sacrifice, and heroism--continues to grow.Part 1 of this volume, ""Materials,"" introduces instructors to the rich array of resources available for teaching Tolkien, including editions and criticism of his fiction and scholarship, historical material on his life and times, audiovisual materials, and film adaptations of his fiction.

This comprehensive critical survey of fantasy cinema demonstrates that the fantasy genre amounts to more than escapism. Through a meticulously researched analysis of more than a century of fantasy pictures--from the seminal work of Georges Melies to Peter Jackson's recent tours of Middle-earth--the work identifies narrative strategies and their recurring components and studies patterns of challenge and return, setting and character. First addressing the difficult task of defining the genre, the work examines fantasy as a cultural force in both film and literature and explores its relation to science fiction, horror, and fairy tales. Fantasy's development is traced from the first days of film, with emphasis on how the evolving genre reflected such events as economic depression and war. Also considered is fantasy's expression of politics, as either the subject of satire or fuel for the fires of propaganda. Discussion ventures into the subgenres, from stories of invented lands inhabited by fantastic creatures to magical adventures set in the familiar world, and addresses clashes between fantasy and faith, such as the religious opposition to the Harry Potter phenomenon. From the money-making classics to little-known arthouse films, this richly illustrated work covers every aspect of fantasy film.  ...more"

The critical responses reflected the confusion: for some, it was an unwelcome reappearance of narrative standards that modernism was supposed to have done away with, or just a bad novel. Others considered it a refreshing work in the epic and romance traditions. Ironically, much of the critical prejudice regarding the question of genre in The Lord of the Rings has been motivated by the same kind of blindness that Tolkien denounced in his famous 1936 lecture Beowulf: the monsters and the critics. Like Beowulf, Tolkien's work has also failed to be properly appreciated and assessed due to a general refusal to accept the centrality of monsters, because despite its 'monstrous' originality and fantastic setting, it is very clearly, and not only chronologically, at the centre of twentieth-century literature. The Lord of the Rings and the Western Narrative Tradition is an attempt to account for the particular genre interaction that governs Tolkien's tale and put it in a meaningful relationship with the contemporary literary context. At the same time, it is a quest to track down one of the most famous and elusive literary monsters of the past century by filling out a long-neglected white space on the map of comparative literature and genre criticism.  ...more"

Even before the notorious Ace pirate editions of 1965 sales were exceptional, and since then they have been astounding -- so how did Tolkien do it? In four sections this book explores Tolkien's improbable triumph, examining how The Lord of the Rings fits into the wider legendarium, the carefully shaped ending (which the films greatly simplify), the Tolkien cult and responses by individual readers, and the growth of Tolkien fanfiction. His professional scholarship, experiences of 1914-18 and 1939-45, and devout Roman Catholicism were vital to his fiction, and the literary appeal of the book's complexity and truth to sadness are explored. But so too are the book's relations with role-playing gaming and associations with political protest, from the Civil Rights and anti-war campaigns of the 1960s to later anti-racist and ecological dissent, with the irrational contempt for Tolkien shown by some critics and the hugely creative responses he continues to provoke and inspire.

Efter hans dod er han blevet verdensberomt for sine litteraere kvaliteter. Han var en sprogkunstner og skrev bade fiktion og lyrik gennem hele sin voksne levetid. Han er forfatteren til eventyrromanen Hobbitten eller ud og hjem igen og trebindsvaerket Ringenes Herre og har ogsa skrevet bogen, Tom Bombadils Eventyr. Disse boger udspiller sig i Tolkiens eget litteraere univers, Midgard; en projektion af nord-vest-Europa i en fiktiv forhistorisk tid. Det er denne verdenen og skabelsen af den, som gjorde ham kendt som den moderne fantastiske litteraturs skaber. Men han var forst og fremmest akademiker og ikke forfatter. Han arbejdede meget pa Beowulf og laerte sig finsk for at laese Kalevala pa originalsproget. Han tilhorte den litteraere diskussionsgruppe, The Inklings, sammen med C. S.

McAleer, a professor of philosophy at Loyola University and Distinguished Teacher of the Year 2014. Author of other books on politics, theology, and philosophy.  ...more"

Tolkien. Ostensibly, The Hobbit is an adventurous tale about hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who leaves the cozy comforts of his home to try to win a share of a treasure guarded by a dragon named Smaug. The novel follows Bilbo and an assorted cast of magical characters and creatures, including dwarves, the wizard Gandolf, giants, goblins, and the mysterious Gollum. Tolkien brings so many different characters to life and keeps the plot moving at a fast enough pace that readers of all kinds have been easily engrossed reading the novel over the last 75 years. Of course, there is a never-ending number of fantasy novels, so why has The Hobbit endured so long and remain as popular as ever before? Part of the reason comes from Tolkien¡¯s background as a professor well versed in Anglo-Saxon literature, which made him extremely familiar with old medieval fairy tales. Others have pointed to his experience in World War I as being responsible for the militaristic and heroic motifs found throughout his books. Furthermore, Tolkien manages to make his characters come across as down to earth, even in the midst of a fantasy world, and at the heart of the novel is a coming of age story that people on Planet Earth have always identified with. The popularity of The Hobbit made Tolkien¡¯s publisher and audience want a follow-up involving his Middle Earth and hobbit creations. To say Tolkien eventually outdid himself in response would be a drastic understatement. What followed was the most famous trilogy of the fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien drew upon his background and spent over a decade fashioning the history of his world and the characters, including some of the old (Gandalf and Bilbo) and a lot of the new (Frodo, Aragorn, Sam). Though Tolkien¡¯s epic fantasy was published more than 50 years ago, it remains a stalwart piece of writing today. More than 150 million copies have been sold in more than 30 languages, and the trilogy is among the top-selling novels of all time. Like The Hobbit, Tolkien¡¯s expertise with language and history inform the story, but The Lord of the Rings is a staggering, complex work for adults, not children. Tolkien took the themes from The Hobbit and revisited them, but this time he went even deeper. The corruptive nature of power and the many forms of bravery are once again front and center as major themes. Working together and the environmental degradation of industrialization and war are also themes woven through the work. Although the fantasy element of The Lord of the Rings is undeniable, it is the human story at the center that truly draws readers in. It is a story of people<U+2014>whether they be dwarves or elves or hobbits<U+2014>who bravely stand up to evil in an effort to make their world a better place. That central story resonates and will continue to resonate. As Tolkien said: ¡°Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.¡±Your Guide to The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings is the perfect resource for understanding Tolkien¡¯s classic books.  ...more"

The course discusses the book's phenomenal success and the life of its author, J. R. R. Tolkien, before embarking on a tour of the world and characters of Middle-earth. Despite the absence of any direct  Joseph Pearce offers a fascinating and insightful course on The Lord of the Rings, which is the greatest and most popular work of literature of the twentieth century. The course discusses the book's phenomenal success and the life of its author, J. R. R. Tolkien, before embarking on a tour of the world and characters of Middle-earth. Despite the absence of any direct mention of Christ or the Catholic Church, Tolkien described his work as ""fundamentally religious and Catholic."" He was able to infuse his fictional world with theological orthodoxy through his creation myth and world order, by endowing his protagonists with Christian virtues, and by incorporating themes of grace and mercy. Tolkien's deep faith and creative philosophy emerges from the narrative as an unmistakable Catholic presence. The very foundation of Tolkien\'s Middle-earth, from its creation by<U+00A0>Eru Iluvatar, the one God, to angel-like Melkor s sinful rebellion, to the menacing presence of Sauron, the dark lord, supports Professor Pearce's argument for the Catholicity of the work. You'll learn how the One Ring symbolizes Original Sin, how the dates Tolkien chose for events in the story are theologically significant, how the Elvish waybread, lembas, figures as the Eucharist, and how Frodo acts as a Christ-figure. Tolkien also describes his work as an allegory of ""power usurped for domination"" - a theme which is all the more important to examine in our modern world. Characters throughout The Lord of the Rings are tempted by power and the urge to seize it and wield it for personal gain and unlawful control. Throughout the journey of the Fellowship, various characters face the temptation of the One Ring - the wizard Gandalf, through whom the Ring would wield a terrible power; human man Boromir, who would use it to save his people; elf queen Galadriel, weary from fighting the ""long defeat"" against evil. Among the characters who do usurp power for domination are Saruman, the white wizard who succumbs to evil, whose machinations at Isengard only bring more evil into Middle-earth. Over the eight lectures in the course, Professor Pearce highlights connections, allegories, and insights which will expand your reading of The Lord of the Rings. It is said that art holds the mirror up to life. This is the reason that art is ""real"" and fiction is ""true"". The Lord of the Rings enjoys such fame and popularity because in a way, it shows us ourselves in the characters.

Additionally, there are Christian themes of the corruption that comes from knowledge, the importance of doing the right thing, the redemptive power of love, and the power that those who appear weak have when it comes to saving the world from evil. All these intertwine with characters and situations, making this sidekick to ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" imperative for total understanding of the complexities involved.

Part of this book explores the influence of the Tolkien industry, in areas like computer gaming, merchandizing and cinema. EXTRACT FROM THE INTRODUCTION Philip Toynbee declared, in 1961, that Tolkiens childish books had passed into a merciful oblivion, a wonderful statement, just a tad inaccurate. In 1997, The Lord of the Rings was voted the top book of the 20th century by readers in a British bookstores poll (Waterstones). 104 out of 105 stores and 25,000 readers put The Lord of the Rings at the (1984 was second). Around 100 million copies of The Lord of the Rings had been sold by the end of the twentieth century, and 60 million copies of The Hobbit, with sales of around 3 million per year of the two books combined. Readers just love reading Tolkiens books. Its that simple. You cant force people to buy books or go see movies; theres isnt a magic formula (or ruling ring) to hypnotize readers and consumers (if there was, itd be worth billions). And the Tolkien phenomenon began with readers. Back in 1937, 1954 and 1955, the publishers Allen & Unwin did their bit, of course, with reviews, blurbs, advertizing and so on, promoting The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, but it was readers who first started the phenomenon that has become truly global. Tolkiens influence on literature has been considerable, too, and not just in the realm of fantasy, sci-fi, fairy tales and related genres. As fantasy author Terry Brooks said, Tolkien was the premier fantasy writer of the last century, and all of us writing today owe him a huge debt. No other writer W.H. Auden reckoned had created an imaginary world and a history in such detail. Colin Wilson agreed that only a few writers have concocted a total universe, and that Tolkiens was very impressive. Tolkiens mythological writings may be the largest body of invented mythology in the history of literature, according to David Day (12). Invented, that is, by one person. Its also certainly the most complex and detailed invented world in all literature (13). JEREMY MARK ROBINSON Jeremy Robinson has written many critical studies, including Steven Spielberg, Arthur Rimbaud, Jean-Luc Godard, and The Sacred Cinema of Andrei Tarkovsky, plus literary monographs on: J.R.R. Tolkien; Samuel Beckett; Thomas Hardy; Andr Gide; Robert Graves; and Lawrence Durrell.  ...more"

Excerpt: The Hobbit, or There and Back Again, better known by its abbreviated title The Hobbit, is a fantasy novel and children's book by J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature. Set in a time ""Between the Dawn of F rie and the Dominion of Men,"" The Hobbit follows the quest of home-loving hobbit Bilbo Baggins to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon, Smaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from light-hearted, rural surroundings into darker, deeper territory. The story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature, or type of creature, of Tolkien's Wilderland. By accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey and adventurous side of his nature (the ""Tookish"" side) and applying his wits and common sense, Bilbo develops a new level of maturity, competence and wisdom. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict. Themes of personal growth and forms of heroism figure in the story. Along with conflict, these themes lead critics to cite Tolkien's own experiences, and those of other writers who fought in World War I, as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Anglo-Saxon literature and interest in fairy tales are also often note...  ...more"

Excerpt: The Lord of the Rings is a high fantasy epic written by philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier, less complex children's fantasy novel The Hobbit (1937), but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during the Second World War. It is the second best-selling novel ever written, with over 150 million copies sold. Although known to most readers as a trilogy, the work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume split into three sections. However, when Tolkien submitted the first volume entitled The Lord of the Rings to his publisher, it was decided for economic reasons to publish the work as three separate volumes, each consisting of two books, over the course of a year in 1954-55, creating the now familiar Lord of the Rings trilogy. The three volumes were entitled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. Structurally, the volumes are divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material, much abbreviated from Tolkien's originals, included at the end of the third volume. The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages, becoming one of the most popular and influential works in the field of 20th-century fantasy li...  ...more"

The Dead Marshes and the approaches to the Morannon owe something to Northern France after the Battle of the Somme. They owe more to William Morris and his Huns and Romans, as in The House of the Wolfings or The Roots of the Mountains.""As The Lord of the Rings was being written, Tolkien¡¯s close friend, C. S. Lewis, wrote that Morris provides his readers with a ¡°pleasure so inexhaustible that after twenty or fifty years of reading they find it worked so deeply into all their emotions as to defy analysis.¡± In words that apply equally well to Tolkien, he said: ""It is indeed, this matter-of-factness . . . which lends to all of Morris¡¯s stories their somber air of conviction. Other stories have only scenery; his have geography. He is not concerned with ¡®painting¡¯ landscapes; he tells you the lie of the land, and then you paint the landscapes for yourself. To a reader long fed on the almost botanical and entomological niceties of much modern fiction . . . the effect is at first very pale and cold, but also fresh and spacious. No mountains in literature are as far away as distant mountains in Morris. The world of his imagining is as windy, as tangible, as resonant and three dimensional, as that of Scott and Homer.""In short, if you like Tolkien¡¯s Aragorn, if you admire the bravery of the Riders of Rohan, if you long for more adventure in an unspoiled wilderness, or if you wish Tolkien had more romances between men and women, then you will be delighted by this tale from William Morris.  ...more"

This fifth volume of the History of Middle-earth, edited by Christopher Tolkien, completes the presentation of the whole compass of his writing on those themes up to that time. Later forms of the Annals of Valinor and the Annals of Beleriand had been composed. The Silmarillion was nearing completion in a greatly amplified version, and a new Map had been made; the myth of the Music of the Ainur had become a separate work; and the legend of the Downfall of Numenor had already entered in a primitive form, introducing the cardinal ideas of the World Made Round and the Straight Path into the vanished West. Closely associated with this was the abandoned 'time-travel' story The Lost Road which was to link the world of Numenor and Middle-earth with the legends of many other times and peoples. A long essay (The Lhammas) had been written on the ever more complex relations of the languages and dialects of Middle-earth; and an 'etymological dictionary' had been undertaken, in which a great number of words and names in the Elvish languages were registered and their formation explained - thus providing by far the most extensive account of their vocabularies that has appeared.The sixth volume of The History of Middle-earth now in preparation will begin the story of the early evolution of The Lord of the Rings.

Dass es Tolkien jedoch zum Beispiel gelungen ist, vor allem die Perspektiven der in diesem Roman vorkommenden Charaktere durch sprachliche Besonderheiten deutlich zu machen, werde ich im Folgenden aufzeigen.Auch existieren sehr unterschiedliche Meinungen zu den beiden auf dem deutschen Markt veroffentlichten Ubersetzungen. Es soll jedoch nicht Sinn dieser Arbeit sein, zu bestimmen, welche besser gelungen ist, sondern nur darzulegen, inwiefern sich die eine von der anderen unterscheidet. Bevor ich jedoch zu meiner Analyse komme, werde ich des Verstandnisses wegen so kurz wie moglich - es sind immerhin mehr als 1300 Seiten Text - beschreiben, worum es sich in The Lord of the Rings handelt.Es ist ein Fantasy-Roman, dessen Geschichte sich im Dritten Zeitalter in Mittelerde abspielt, wo viele verschiedene Volker von Sauron, dem Dunklen Herrscher, bedroht werden. Seine Macht ist durch einen Ring begrundet, der vernichtet werden muss, um Sauron endgultig zu besiegen. Diesen einen Ring verlor Sauron in einem Gefecht, das in einem fruheren Zeitalter stattfand. Nun besitzt ihn Bilbo, ein Hobbit aus dem Auenland, der jedoch zu alt geworden ist, um zu den Schicksalskluften des Vulkans im Herzen von Saurons Land Mordor zu reisen und den Ring dort zu zerstoren. Sein Neffe Frodo ubernimmt also diese Aufgabe und wird bei dieser Reise von einer gemischten Gesellschaft begleitet: drei andere Hobbits (Sam, Merry und Pippin), zwei Menschen (Boromir, Sohn Denethors, der das Land Gondor regiert, und Aragorn, sein noch unerkannter rechtmassiger Konig), ein Zwerg (Gimli), ein Elb (Legolas) und der Zauberer Gandalf als Anfuhrer.

Adapting literary works to silver screen has been a major point of interest among film directors and producers since the earliest stages of film development. During the twentieth century numerous movie adaptations of novels,  A different view (concise, condensed and argumentative) on the narrative techniques and elements in The Lord of the Rings the novel and the movie. Adapting literary works to silver screen has been a major point of interest among film directors and producers since the earliest stages of film development. During the twentieth century numerous movie adaptations of novels, short stories, dramas and other publications were realized, but little room was devoted to the adaptations of fantasy works, mainly because of the inability to transfer the elements of fantasy to the big screen. However, recent development in movie technology and technique sparked a new interest in fantasy adaptation and we have been witnesses of major changes happening in movie industry regarding science fiction and fantasy genres. One of the most important fantasy novels from the middle of the twentieth century, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings saw its full movie adaptation at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This book deals with the key points of narrative technique in the novel and the movie The Lord of the Rings, and the problems of transferring a narrative from one medium to another. The book is divided into two main parts, one dealing with the novel (which is more theoretical and provides a deeper analysis of storytelling in the novel) and the other dealing with the movie (which is more of a discussion on how the narrative changes in the process of adaptation). Mieke Bal's Narratology: Introduction to the Theory of Narrative and Gerard Genette's Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method, supplemented by Gerald Prince's Dictionary of Narratology, are used in order to pinpoint the main characteristics of narrative in the book. The analysis of the narrative technique in the film is based on Kristin Thompsons's theory presented in Storytelling in the New Hollywood: Understanding Classical Narrative Technique, together with the video testimonies of Peter Jackson, the movie director, and the crew which worked on the film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. This book's purpose is to give a closer look at narrative technique J.R.R.Tolkien used while writing the book and narrative technique Peter Jackson used when creating the movie, to examine the question of adaptability of the narrative technique used during the adaptation and to give a small insight into what changes in the process of transferring characters, places and events that we love, from the novel into the movie. Reading this book will help you see the subtleties of the Lord of the Rings that cannot be regularly and easily noticed and also arm you with the knowledge of narrative elements in storytelling in novels and movies through the analysis of The Lord of the Rings. The book can be read either as a critical source or additional information on narration/storytelling, depending on the requirements a reader has, but it is mostly helpful to fans of Tolkien's/Jackson's works and those who would like to find out more about the intricacies of storytelling.  ...more"

But it is, of course, a constant source of consolation and pleasure to me. And, I may say, a piece of singular good fortune, much envied by some of my contemporaries. Wonderful people still buy the book, and to a man 'retired' that is both grateful and comforting.¡± <U+2013> J.R.R. TolkienFor more than half a century, the name J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973) has been synonymous with epic fantasy. Known across the world for his classic The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Tolkien both revived interest in fantasy literature and set the standard for the genre. Today he is widely acknowledged as the ¡°Father¡± of modern fantasy and its most famous author. While Tolkien made Middle Earth famous and vice-versa, Tolkien¡¯s works were influenced by a lifetime of Tolkien¡¯s own personal experiences. His tales concern creatures of myth, yet the plot lines and characters are human at heart. Tolkien drew his inspiration from war, nature, history, love, and language, and through the lens of fantasy he examined bravery, loyalty and friendship. That essential ¡°humanness¡± at the core of his writing, whether it was displayed by a man, hobbit, or even a tree, struck a chord with readers that continues to resonate today. ¡°In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.¡± So starts one of Western literature¡¯s most epic journeys, The Hobbit, a fantasy novel that has delighted adults and children alike since it was published in 1937. Ostensibly, The Hobbit is an adventurous tale about hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who leaves the cozy comforts of his home to try to win a share of a treasure guarded by a dragon named Smaug. The novel follows Bilbo and an assorted cast of magical characters and creatures, including dwarves, the wizard Gandolf, giants, goblins, and the mysterious Gollum. Tolkien brings so many different characters to life and keeps the plot moving at a fast enough pace that readers of all kinds have been easily engrossed reading the novel over the last 75 years. The popularity of The Hobbit made Tolkien¡¯s publisher and audience want a follow-up involving his Middle Earth and hobbit creations. To say Tolkien eventually outdid himself in response would be a drastic understatement. What followed was the most famous trilogy of the fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien drew upon his background and spent over a decade fashioning the history of his world and the characters, including some of the old (Gandalf and Bilbo) and a lot of the new (Frodo, Aragorn, Sam). Though Tolkien¡¯s epic fantasy was published more than 50 years ago, it remains a stalwart piece of writing today. More than 150 million copies have been sold in more than 30 languages, and the trilogy is among the top-selling novels of all time. J.R.R. Tolkien, The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings is the perfect resource for understanding Tolkien¡¯s classic books. In addition to exploring Tolkien¡¯s life and experiences, this guide explains the background of each book, including its characters and plot, its major themes, and its influential and enduring legacy.  ...more"

Located at CERN, near Geneva, LEP was built during the years 1983 - 1989, was operational until 2000, and corroborated the standard model of particle physics through continuous high precision measurements.The Author, director-general of CERN during the crucial period of the construction of LEP, recounts vividly the convoluted decision-making and technical implementation processes - the tunnel alone being a highly challenging geo- and civil engineering project - and the subsequent extremely fruitful period of scientific research. Finally he describes the difficult decision to close down LEP, at a time when the discovery of the Higgs boson seemed within reach.LEP was eventually dismantled in 2000, enabling the tunnel to be reused for building the next generation machine, the much more powerful Large Hadron Collider (LHC), an upgrade then called LEP3 and foreseen from the beginning. It became operational just as this account was being completed.Written by the main protagonist responsible for making LEP a reality, this is the definitive inside story of a remarkable machine and the many thousands of scientists and engineers from around the world, whose efforts contributed to the new knowledge it produced.  ...more"

Throughout the ages, the communication of Christian truth has been the domain of preachers and poets, musicians and theologians, authors and dramatists, each seeking means by which to engage others in the truth that has captivated and transformed their lives. From direct proposition to allegorical representation, such effective communicators as Dwight L. Moody and C. S. Lewis have confronted their culture with Christian truth in response to Jesus' command to ""go and make disciples"". J. R. R. Tolkien employed myth as his vehicle of expression, creating The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) with no overt religious symbol or act, yet weaving his Roman Catholic Christian worldview into the very fabric of his characters and their journeys. Tolkien described his work as a ""fundamentally religious and Catholic work, unconsciously at first, but consciously in the revision, with religious element absorbed into the story.""1 He discovered that myth allows the reader opportunity to explore the realities of life within the safety of an imagined world and its relationship.;Tolkien's fantasy of Middle Earth and her people has captured the heart and mind of generations since its publication in 1954, offering glimpses into the truth that defined Tolkien's life and worldview. This 20th century work found new expression and an even broader audience in Peter Jackson's 21st century cinematic interpretation LOTR. Together, Tolkien's myth and Jackson's cinematic portrayal of that myth have successfully captured the attention of the Emerging generation. A study of both narrative and cinematic mediums along with the clarity of the message conveyed will allow an opportunity to consider the larger question of what medium and what message impacts the emerging post-modern generation. This dissertation will explore the effectiveness of Tolkien's myth and Jackson's cinematic interpretation of that myth in communicating truth, seeking insights into effective means of the communication of Christian truth in a post-Christian culture.;1Carpenter.

Excerpt: The Lord of the Rings is an epic film trilogy consisting of three fantasy adventure films based on the three-volume book of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien. The films are The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). The films were directed by Peter Jackson and distributed by New Line Cinema. Considered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious movie projects ever undertaken, with an overall budget of $285 million, the entire project took eight years, with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand. Each film in the trilogy also had Special Extended Editions, released on DVD a year after the theatrical releases. While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the plot elements from the novel and include some additions to and other deviations from the source material. Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the three films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) as he and a Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, and thus ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. The Fellowship becomes divided and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion Sam (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, unite and rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, who are ultimately victorious in the War of the Ring. The trilogy was a great financial success, with the films collectively being the sixth highest-grossing film se...  ...more"

It is given its title in an index to songs and poems usually published in the third volume, The Return of the King . Context The hobbit Frodo Baggins is traveling to Bucklebury in the Shire, accompanied by his gardener and friend Sam Gamgee and his kinsman Pippin Took . Frodo is ostensibly moving to a newly purchased house, having sold his old house Bag End to his relatives, the Sackville Baggins. However, he and Sam have secretly planned to journey beyond, to Bree where he will meet again with Gandalf, so that they can travel to Rivendell; Frodo has the Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron in his possession, and he believes it will be safe there. They journey into the night, and at this point They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. With most hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). Frodo's cousin Bilbo Baggins, who had adopted him and considered him his nephew, had made up the words ""to a tune that was as old as the hills, and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Water-valley and talked about Adventure."" After the song ends, the hobbits encounter a Black Rider for the second time. The song is mirrored at the end ...  ...more"

Excerpt: "" A Walking Song "" is a poem in the form of a song from J. R. R. Tolkien 's fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings, originally published in three volumes. It appears in the third chapter of the novel, entitled ""Three is Company""; usually as part of the first volume, The Fellowship of the Ring . It is given its title in an index to songs and poems usually published in the third volume, The Return of the King . Context The hobbit Frodo Baggins is traveling to Bucklebury in the Shire, accompanied by his gardener and friend Sam Gamgee and his kinsman Pippin Took . Frodo is ostensibly moving to a newly purchased house, having sold his old house Bag End to his relatives, the Sackville Baggins. However, he and Sam have secretly planned to journey beyond, to Bree where he will meet again with Gandalf, so that they can travel to Rivendell; Frodo has the Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron in his possession, and he believes it will be safe there. They journey into the night, and at this point They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. With most hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). Frodo's cousin Bilbo Baggins, who had adopted him and considered him his nephew, had made up the words ""to a tune that was as old as the hills, and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Water-valley and talked about Adventure."" After the song ends, the hobbits encounter a Black Rider for the second time. The song is mirrored at the end ...  ...more"

The films are The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). The films were directed by Peter Jackson and distributed by New Line Cinema. Considered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious movie projects ever undertaken, with an overall budget of $285 million, the entire project took eight years, with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand. Each film in the trilogy also had Special Extended Editions, released on DVD a year after the theatrical releases. While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the plot elements from the novel and include some additions to and other deviations from the source material. Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the three films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) as he and a Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, and thus ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. The Fellowship becomes divided and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion Sam (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, unite and rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, who are ultimately victorious in the War of the Ring.

Excerpt: Krishna ( in Devanagari, in kannada in IAST, pronounced literally ""dark, black, dark-blue"") is a central figure of Hinduism and is the central character of the Bhagavad Gita, along with Arjuna. He is an Avatar of Vishnu and considered in some monotheistic traditions as the Supreme Being. Krishna is identified as a historical individual who participated in the events of the Mah bh rata. Krishna is often described as an infant or young boy playing a flute as in the Bhagavata Purana, or as a youthful prince giving direction and guidance as in the Bhagavad Gita. The stories of Krishna appear across a broad spectrum of Hindu philosophical and theological traditions. They portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero and the Supreme Being. The principal scriptures discussing Krishna's story are the Mahabharata, the Harivamsa, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana. Worship of a deity or hero called Krishna, in the form of Vasudeva, Bala Krishna or Gopala, can be traced to as early as 4th century BC.

This comprehensive critical survey of fantasy cinema demonstrates that the fantasy genre amounts to more than escapism. Through a meticulously researched analysis of more than a century of fantasy pictures--from the seminal work of Georges Melies to Peter Jackson's recent tours of Middle-earth--the work identifies narrative strategies and their recurring components and studies patterns of challenge and return, setting and character. First addressing the difficult task of defining the genre, the work examines fantasy as a cultural force in both film and literature and explores its relation to science fiction, horror, and fairy tales. Fantasy's development is traced from the first days of film, with emphasis on how the evolving genre reflected such events as economic depression and war. Also considered is fantasy's expression of politics, as either the subject of satire or fuel for the fires of propaganda. Discussion ventures into the subgenres, from stories of invented lands inhabited by fantastic creatures to magical adventures set in the familiar world, and addresses clashes between fantasy and faith, such as the religious opposition to the Harry Potter phenomenon.

The world of Middle-earth was conceived by an author  For decades millions of people have enjoyed reading J. R. R. Tolkien¡¯s The Lord of the Rings. This seminal work of modern fantasy was deservedly voted the greatest book of the twentieth century by major British booksellers. But The Lord of the Rings is more than a great work of fantasy, more than an epic adventure story. The world of Middle-earth was conceived by an author whose fantasy world was informed by his biblical and Catholic beliefs. Because of this, his novel is filled to the brim with timeless truth and wisdom. Middle-earth is a world of ethical absolutes and very real evil. Its history is one great and marvelous tapestry, tightly and flawlessly woven by Providence. Prophecy is its organizing motif and unifying feature. All of its prophetic elements pertain to a providential plan to deliver Middle-earth from the evil power and designs of Sauron. Scriptural allusions abound, for Tolkien has saturated his fantasy novel with allusions to biblical ideas, scenes, and characters. These themes, and more, emerge in brilliant detail in Joseph E. O¡¯Day¡¯s The Ring of Truth: Truth and Wisdom in J. R. R. Tolkien¡¯s The Lord of the Rings.Tolkien wrote that his fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings ¡°is about God, and his sole right to divine honour. The Eldar and the Numenoreans believed in The One, the true God, and held worship of any other person an abomination.¡± Consequently, Tolkien¡¯s novel contains Christian truth and wisdom that has much to say about our beliefs, our world, our spirituality, and ourselves. Divine providence, ethical absolutes, beauty, temptation, mercy, joy, courage, and self-sacrifice are but a few of the twenty-four prominent themes from Middle-earth that resonate with the ring of truth. Some other themes of truth and wisdom in The Ring of Truth:Prophecy, Resurrection, Spiritual Healing, The Reality of Evil, Faithfulness, Hope, Humility & Pride, Righteous Anger, Everyday Wisdom, and Loyalty & Friendship.  ...more"

Located at CERN, near Geneva, LEP was built during the years 1983 - 1989, was operational until 2000, and corroborated the standard model of particle physics through continuous high precision measurements.The Author, director-general of CERN during the crucial period of the construction of LEP, recounts vividly the convoluted decision-making and technical implementation processes - the tunnel alone being a highly challenging geo- and civil engineering project - and the subsequent extremely fruitful period of scientific research. Finally he describes the difficult decision to close down LEP, at a time when the discovery of the Higgs boson seemed within reach.LEP was eventually dismantled in 2000, enabling the tunnel to be reused for building the next generation machine, the much more powerful Large Hadron Collider (LHC), an upgrade then called LEP3 and foreseen from the beginning. It became operational just as this account was being completed.Written by the main protagonist responsible for making LEP a reality, this is the definitive inside story of a remarkable machine and the many thousands of scientists and engineers from around the world, whose efforts contributed to the new knowledge it produced.  ...more"

Tolkien never intended to write immensely popular literature that would challenge traditional ideas about the nature of great literature and that was worthy of study in colleges across the world. He set out only to write a good story, the kind of story he and his friends would enjoy reading. In The Hobbit and in The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien created an entire world informed by his vast knowledge of mythology, languages, and medieval literature. In the 1960s, his books unexpectedly gained cult status with a new generation of young, countercultural readers. Today, the readership for Tolkien's absorbing secondary world--filled with monsters, magic, adventure, sacrifice, and heroism--continues to grow.Part 1 of this volume, ""Materials,"" introduces instructors to the rich array of resources available for teaching Tolkien, including editions and criticism of his fiction and scholarship, historical material on his life and times, audiovisual materials, and film adaptations of his fiction. The essays in part 2, ""Approaches,"" help instructors introduce students to critical debates around Tolkien's work, its sources, its influence, and its connection to ecology, religion, and science.

Excerpt: In 1981 the UK radio station BBC Radio 4 broadcast a dramatisation of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings in 26 half-hour stereo installments. This followed a previous 12-part BBC Radio adaptation in 1955 and 1956, of which no recordings are known to have survived, and a 1979 recording by National Public Radio in the USA. Like the novel on which it is based, The Lord of the Rings is the story of an epic struggle against the Dark Lord Sauron of Mordor, the primary villain of the work, who created a Ruling Ring to control the nineteen Rings of Power, and an alliance of heroes who join forces to save the world from falling under his shadow. Each of the original 26 episodes received two broadcasts per week, individual evening broadcasts of the 30 minute episodes with an hour long ""omnibus"" repeat on Sunday mornings standard practice for many BBC radio serials even today. The first broadcast of Episode 2 was blacked out across a large part of southeast England because of a transmitter failure (a very rare occurrence even then). The series was also broadcast in the US on NPR with a new synopsis preceding each episode, narrated by Tammy Grimes. It was also aired in Australia. A soundtrack album featuring a completely re-recorded and in some cases expanded, suite of Stephen Oliver's music was released in 1981. The 26-part series was subsequently edited into 13 hour-long episodes, restoring some dialogue originally cut for timing (since each hour-long episode is actually around 57 minutes, as opposed to 54 minutes for two half-hour episodes with overlaps and extra credits removed), rearranging some scenes for dramatic impact and adding linking narration and music cues.

Excerpt: The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game (abbreviated to LotR SBG), and often referred to by players as Lord of the Rings, is a tabletop miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop (GW). It is based on The Lord of the Rings film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and the book that inspired it, written by J. R. R. Tolkien. The game was initially released in 2001 to coincide in with the movie The Fellowship of the Ring. New box sets with updated rules were also released for The Two Towers and The Return of the King movies. Later, beginning with the Shadow and Flame supplement, Games Workshop began to add content that was featured in the original book but not in the film adaptations: e.g. Tom Bombadil, Radagast and Glorfindel. Games Workshop has also expanded its license with original material on areas such as Harad and Khand, with mixed reactions. The most recent complete edition of the rules, often called The One Rulebook to Rule them All, was released by Games Workshop in September 2005, while a compact edition entitled The Mines of Moria was also released. In early 2009 Games Workshop also released an expansion to the original game called War of the Ring which, according to the company, allows players to emulate the large battles included in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings by streamlining the game system. This expansion differs from the main game in a several ways. Firstly War of the Ring uses a larger number of models but the models are placed on movement trays with two cavalry models or eight infantry models on each. This allows for much easier and quicker movement of large numbers of models at once. These are called ""companies."" Larger creatures...More: http: //booksllc.net/?id=173954  ...more"

Excerpt: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a 2003 fantasy-adventure film directed by Peter Jackson that is based on the second and third volumes of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is the concluding film in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, following The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and The Two Towers (2002). As Sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of Middle-earth, Gandalf the Wizard, and Theoden King of Rohan rally their forces to help defend Gondor's capital Minas Tirith from the looming threat. Aragorn finally claims the throne of Gondor and summons an army of ghosts to help him defeat Sauron. Ultimately, even with full strength of arms, they realize they cannot win; so it comes down to the Hobbits, Frodo and Sam, to bear the burden of the Ring and deal with the treachery of Gollum. After a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous lands of Mordor, seeking to destroy the One Ring in the place it was created, the volcanic fires of Mount Doom. Released on December 17, 2003, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King received rave reviews and became one of the greatest box-office successes of all time. It won all eleven Academy Awards for which it was nominated, which ties it with only Titanic and Ben-Hur for most Academy Awards ever won.

Fans of Tolkien praise the writer's deep understanding of the female mind while on the other side his critics mourn about a medieval and chauvinistic perception of women in his books. In this paper, I want to examine the role of women in Tolkien's most popular and successful book The Lord of the Rings. In the first chapter I will describe the female characters as the y are presented in the book. I will put special emphasis on how the women's sexuality is presented. In the second chapter, I will analyse the most important character traits that distinguish the 'good' from the 'bad' women in The Lord of the Rings: subordination, self- denial and weakness. The third chapter will deal with the vices that are represented by some of the female characters: temptation and evil. In the last chapter I will conclude the paper by summarising anddiscussing the main arguments of the first three chapters. I will also briefly discuss the consequences of such a presentation of women in literature. Tolkien gave birth to different kinds of fantasy races in The Lord of the Rings. I am aware of the fact that not all of the females in his work are humans. However, I found it less disturbing to the flow of the paper to speak of women rather than females all the time. I hope the reader will excuse that.  ...more"

Excerpt: Fritz the Cat is a 1972 American animated comedy film written and directed by Ralph Bakshi as his feature film debut. Based on the comic strip of the same name by Robert Crumb, the film was the first animated feature film to receive an X rating in the United States. It focuses on Fritz (voiced by Skip Hinnant), an anthropomorphic feline in mid-1960s New York City who explores the ideals of hedonism and sociopolitical consciousness. The film is a satire focusing on American college life of the era, race relations, the free love movement, and left- and right-wing politics. Fritz the Cat is the most successful independent animated feature of all time, grossing over $100 million worldwide. After Bakshi graduated from High School of Art and Design, he worked on cartoon shorts for Terrytoon Studios for ten years and eventually started up his own animation studio. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. He soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. However, producer Steve Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. Later, Bakshi came across a copy of Fritz the Cat while browsing a bookstore. Impressed by Crumb's satire, Bakshi suggested to Krantz that it could be worked into a film. The film had a troubled production history and controversial release. Crumb is known to have had disagreements with the filmmakers, claiming in interviews that his first wife signed over the film rights to the characters, and that he did n...  ...more"

Not illustrated. Excerpt: Tolkien: A Look Behind ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a study of the works of J. R. R. Tolkien written by Lin Carter. It was first published in paperback by Ballantine Books in March, 1969 and went through numerous additional printings in the years following before going out of print. The book was among the earliest full-length critical works devoted to Tolkien's fantasies, and the first to set his writings in their proper context in the history of fantasy. It was the earliest of three important studies by Carter devoted to fantasy/horror writers and the history of fantasy, being followed by Lovecraft: A Look Behind the ""Cthulhu Mythos"" (1972) and Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy (1973), and helped establish him as an authority on the genre, indirectly leading to his editorial guidance of the groundbreaking Ballantine Adult Fantasy series. A new hardback edition updated by Adam Roberts was published by Gollancz in August, 2003. Carter's study was intended to serve as an introduction to Tolkien for those unfamiliar with his work. His introduction briefly reviews the publishing phenomenon of The Lord of the Rings and its burgeoning popularity in the wake of the first paperback editions in the 1960s, after which he devotes three chapters to a short biography of the author through the late 1960s, including an account of how The Lord of the Rings was written.

(Elliott quoting from Burgess, 2004, p.235) This quote probably describes what Peter Jackson also had in mind when he read The Lord of the Rings for the first time and what influenced him to make a Hollywood movie out of this most famous work of fantasy fiction. Reading a book and feeling a need to see the characters, to hear their voices and follow them through their adventure, is probably also the experience many readers of The lord of the Rings trilogy had. And they expressed this feeling by watching the movies in the cinemas more than just a single time. The amount of money the movies brought in was incredible. The box office reported a worldwide total of approximately 3 billion dollars, which merely includes the amount, brought in by the movie-goers, and not even the sale of the DVDs and other merchandising articles. How many of them had actually read the novels before is not clear, but it seems obvious that many of them were craving for a filmic adaptation of their favourite book. However, this is not the only truth concerning the movies. Right after the start of the first film, the fan community of the book started criticizing the adaptation in a substantial amount of Internet forums. According to them, too many changes had been made, too many chapters had been left out and too many new aspects had been included. The fans claimed that Jackson had financial reasons in mind rather than fidelity to the original. The question came and still comes up, if the filmic adaptation was really a good representation  ...more"

Fans of Tolkien praise the writer's deep understanding of the female mind while on the other side his critics mourn about a medieval and chauvinistic perception of women in his books. In this paper, I want to examine the role of women in Tolkien's most popular and successful book The Lord of the Rings. In the first chapter I will describe the female characters as the y are presented in the book. I will put special emphasis on how the women's sexuality is presented. In the second chapter, I will analyse the most important character traits that distinguish the 'good' from the 'bad' women in The Lord of the Rings: subordination, self- denial and weakness. The third chapter will deal with the vices that are represented by some of the female characters: temptation and evil. In the last chapter I will conclude the paper by summarising anddiscussing the main arguments of the first three chapters. I will also briefly discuss the consequences of such a presentation of women in literature. Tolkien gave birth to different kinds of fantasy races in The Lord of the Rings. I am aware of the fact that not all of the females in his work are humans. However, I found it less disturbing to the flow of the paper to speak of women rather than females all the time. I hope the reader will excuse that.  ...more"

Chapters: Fritz the Cat, The Lord of the Rings, Coonskin, American Pop, Cool World, Wizards, Heavy Traffic, Hey Good Lookin', Fire and Ice, Cool and the Crazy, Last Days of Coney Island. Excerpt: Fritz the Cat is a 1972 American animated comedy film written and directed by Ralph Bakshi as his feature film debut. Based on the comic strip of the same name by Robert Crumb, the film was the first animated feature film to receive an X rating in the United States. It focuses on Fritz (voiced by Skip Hinnant), an anthropomorphic feline in mid-1960s New York City who explores the ideals of hedonism and sociopolitical consciousness. The film is a satire focusing on American college life of the era, race relations, the free love movement, and left- and right-wing politics. Fritz the Cat is the most successful independent animated feature of all time, grossing over $100 million worldwide. After Bakshi graduated from High School of Art and Design, he worked on cartoon shorts for Terrytoon Studios for ten years and eventually started up his own animation studio. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. He soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. However, producer Steve Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience.

Excerpt: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a 2003 epic fantasy-drama film directed by Peter Jackson that is based on the second and third volumes of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is the concluding film in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, following The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and The Two Towers (2002). As Sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of Middle-earth, Gandalf the Wizard, and Theoden King of Rohan rally their forces to help defend Gondor's capital Minas Tirith from the looming threat. Aragorn finally claims the throne of Gondor and summons an army of ghosts to help him defeat Sauron. Ultimately, even with full strength of arms, they realise they cannot win; so it comes down to the Hobbits, Frodo and Sam, to bear the burden of the Ring and deal with the treachery of Gollum. After a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous lands of Mordor, seeking to destroy the One Ring in the place it was created, the volcanic fires of Mount Doom. Released on 17 December 2003, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King received rave reviews and became one of the greatest critical and box-office successes of all time, becoming the highest grossing film from New Line Cinema, as well as the biggest financial success for Time Warner in general, until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 surpassed The Return of the King's final gross in 2011.

Sports Illustrated ranks it as one of the Top One Hundred Sports Books of all Time. The IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch was outraged that his secret 37-year-history of jackbooting, right-arm saluting fascist activities in Franco¡¯s Spain had been uncovered. He had the authors¡¯ phones hacked and then persuaded a Swiss court to impose suspended jail sentences on them. That ¡®F-word¡¯ is forbidden in Olympic circles. Officials, sponsors and sports reporters shrink from admitting the contradictions of an organisation that claims to represent the aspirations of young people - but continues to honour its former leader whose life was dedicated to delivering sport for a repugnant dictatorship and then privatised to serve the needs of the global brands. The result of years of investigations by award-winning corruption specialists, ¡®Lords¡¯ reveals how positive drugs tests were concealed so that the Olympic Games could be sold as ¡®clean¡¯ to sponsors, rebranded as ¡®partners,¡¯ while heavily doped male and female athletes were changing sex! The book reveals the beginnings of what became the gigantic ISL marketing contracts scandal and the $100 million worth of bribes and kickbacks paid to sports officials. Honest IOC members were persuaded to disclose how one close ally of Samaranch was ¡®elected¡¯ to the IOC by 13 votes to 10 <U+2013> with 60 abstentions! This classic of iconoclastic journalism, first published in 1992, foreshadowed the Salt Lake City cash-and-sex for votes scandal that convulsed the Olympic world.An essential read for sports fans and has been longtime listed as mandatory reading for sports and journalism students.  ...more"

Tolkien¡¯s classic High Fantasy epic, Lord of the Rings, is it not? However, the above narrative may be more than a fantastic story. Is it possible Tolkien was inspired by astounding Roman Catholic prophecies yet to be fulfilled? In fact, not many Catholics are aware of these prophecies, and for those who have read them do not believe, for they indeed sound surreal as though penned by a fiction author despite having been imparted by approved saints and mystics of the Church.These little known prophecies may sound fantastic, but in truth are downright frightening, condemning the sinful corruption of both the Church and the secular world alike. One may dare to suggest these foretellings have been suppressed from the majority of the faithful due to the damning nature of the warnings from Heaven despite receiving Church approval. Yet, the prophecies are available for those who seek, and Tolkien being a devout Catholic may have woven threads of these revelations into his famous epic as the reader will discover in ¡°Lord of the Rings: Apocalyptic Prophecies¡±.

It was a muscled four-footed creature, with long distorted arms and poisonous claws, with a twisted neck and a huge hunch in the back. They were both male and female Aka-Name, and supposedly reproduced like humans. They could run more quickly than normal humans. Aka-name were cunning creatures with limited intelligence which dwelled in Shadowlands and rarely ventured inside the Empire. Traveled alone or in small groups, used ambush to feed as scavengers, or ate filth and excrement when no flesh was available. No language was known, but communicated in grunts and bestial noises. They did not confronted more powerful entities like oni and Lost.

As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star,  Kobe Bean Bryant (August 23, 1978 - January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), two-time NBA Finals MVP winner. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he led the NBA in scoring during two seasons, ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists.Bryant was the son of former NBA player Joe Bryant. He attended Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania, where he was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the country. Upon graduation, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault by a 19-year-old hotel clerk. Criminal charges were brought and then dropped after the accuser refused to testify, with a civil suit later settled out of court. Bryant denied the assault charge but admitted to a sexual encounter and issued a public apology.After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single game in league history, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon at age 34. Although he recovered from that injury, he suffered season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing his physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015-16 season.At 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. He became the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history on February 1, 2010, surpassing Jerry West. Bryant was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four All-Star MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname ""Black Mamba"" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for his 2017 film Dear Basketball.Bryant died at age 41, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others, in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.  ...more"

Warden III's theory of five strategic rings, which the author argues is often neglected in the debate over the importance of leadership (first ring)  This interesting study by Lt Col Edward J. Felker, US Air Force, describes a methodology to exploit airpower's capacities at the operational and strategic levels of war. It focuses on the third ring (infrastructure) of John A. Warden III's theory of five strategic rings, which the author argues is often neglected in the debate over the importance of leadership (first ring) versus fielded forces (fifth ring). The author emphasizes that lines of communications transmit all of society's military, economic, and political goods, services, and information. Infrastructure provides the framework that links the various elements of a nation's power. This infrastructure contains critical nodes that are vulnerable to airpower. By understanding this infrastructure, we better understand an adversary as a complex, adaptive, and open system. Colonel Felker's paper espouses a practical theory of airpower based on the synergistic relationship among societal structure and lines of communications that comprise infrastructure. Rather than isolating different elements of a society and their concomitant targets, the theory views targets in a more holistic way. Of note, the theory articulates a culturally based paradigm with airpower applied against the linkages within a society's system processes, rather than a ""one-size-fits-all"" target list that attacks form. The theory describes a way to think about airpower, not a way to execute its missions.  ...more"

As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star,  Kobe Bean Bryant (August 23, 1978 - January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), two-time NBA Finals MVP winner. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he led the NBA in scoring during two seasons, ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists.Bryant was the son of former NBA player Joe Bryant. He attended Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania, where he was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the country. Upon graduation, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault by a 19-year-old hotel clerk. Criminal charges were brought and then dropped after the accuser refused to testify, with a civil suit later settled out of court. Bryant denied the assault charge but admitted to a sexual encounter and issued a public apology.After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single game in league history, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon at age 34. Although he recovered from that injury, he suffered season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing his physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015-16 season.At 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. He became the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history on February 1, 2010, surpassing Jerry West. Bryant was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four All-Star MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname ""Black Mamba"" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for his 2017 film Dear Basketball.Bryant died at age 41, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others, in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.  ...more"

Lines of communication transmit all of a society's military, economic, and political goods, services, and information. Infrastructure provides the framework that links the various elements of a nation's power. This infrastructure contains critical nodes that are vulnerable to airpower. By understanding this infrastructue, we better understand an adversary as a complex, adaptive, and open system. The paper espouses a practical theory of airpower based on the synergistic relationship among societal structure and lines of communication that comprise infrastructure. Rather than isolating different elements of a society and their concomitant targets, the theory views targets in a more holistic way. Of note, the theory articulates a culturally based paradigm with airpower applied against the linkages within a society's systems processes, rather than a ""one-size-fits-all"" target list (form). The theory describes a way to think about airpower, not a way to execute its missions.  ...more"

A grid of hexagons is superimposed over the terrain to regulate movement in much the same manner as the squares do on a chess board.The pieces in the game represent the various military units and characters who played a role in Tolkien's fantasy war. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths and abilities of these units. Each player maneuvers his pieces on the map in turn; then the units of both sides may engage in battle when they occupy the same hex. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared, along with various modifications for terrain and special character abilities, and the players consult the appropriate tables to determine the outcome in terms of casualties to either side. The game proceeds in this manner for a specified number of game turns as the Players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules.

Wildlife is its most notable feature. The Galapagos Islands and its surrounding waters form an Ecuadorian province, a national park, and a biological marine reserve. The principal language on the islands is Spanish. The islands have a population of around 23,000. The islands are geologically young and famed for their vast number of endemic species, which were studied by Charles Darwin during the voyage of the Beagle. His observations and collections contributed to the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The first crude navigation chart of the islands was done by the buccaneer Ambrose Cowley in 1684. He named the individual islands after some of his fellow pirates or after the English noblemen who helped the privateer's cause.

Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault by a 19-year-old hotel clerk. Criminal charges were brought and then dropped after the accuser refused to testify, with a civil suit later settled out of court. Bryant denied the assault charge but admitted to a sexual encounter and issued a public apology.After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single game in league history, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon at age 34. Although he recovered from that injury, he suffered season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing his physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015-16 season.At 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. He became the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history on February 1, 2010, surpassing Jerry West. Bryant was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four All-Star MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname ""Black Mamba"" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for his 2017 film Dear Basketball.Bryant died at age 41, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others, in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.  ...more"
